           <p>Hi!<br><br>
               Kitni ajeeb baat hai na, ki pehle tu mujhe apne baare me sab bataya karti thi, aur ab jab sab kuch waise hi chal rah jaised ki tum chati thi to hamari baat hi band ho gayi.<br>
               Itna mushkil hai kya yaar, ek Hi kehna. Session ke starting week mujhe kaafi bura laga, phir khayal aaya ki jab tere liye har chiz theek ho hi gayi to phir ab kya hi fark padta hai. uske baad maine ek-do baar koshish bhi ki tujhse baat karne ki, socha ki tu kabhi saamne se ayegi me Hi karunga aur uske baad to baatein start ho hi jayegi lekin najane kyon tu jab bhi aas paas hoti hai to mujhse nazrein hi nahi milati, aur phir kuch dinno baad to maine bhi chor diya ki jaise chal raha chalne do. Tu to keh rahi thi ki sab kuch thik ho jayega, lekin sab to aur bhi bikharta jaa raha, apan phirse wahi aa gaye jahan ek saal pehle the. Ab mai kaise na maanu ki I am the third person in this story. Sach kahun to pichle semester kuch zyada hi ehmiyat de di tune mujhe, itni nahi deni chahiye thi. Nahi karti baatein, ab tumhe to bahoto log kahenge ki they have a crush on you, to iska matlab ye to nahi ki tum apni saari baatein unhe batane lago. Aur mai tumhe ye sab isliye nahi keh raha taki tumhe bura lage balki isliye keh rah kyonki mujhe khudke liye kaafi bura lag raha hai yaar. Terko pata hai mere sath hamesha aisa hi hua hai, I mean chizen kabhi mere hisaab se chali nahi lekin iss baar jinta bura lag raha hai utna kabhi nahi laga, kyonki shayad itne efforts maine kisike liye kabhi maare hi nahi. Terko pata hai before you, I have never sketched anyones portrait. Aur tumhara sketch banane se pehle maine 12 copies aur banayi thi aur 13th time mai jo bana tha vo maine tumhe gift kiya aur sath ke sath pichle 12 sketches bhi maine sambhal kar rakhe the, lekin tumhare birthday ke samay wale chat ke baad maine saare fek diye. Terko to shayad pata hi hoga ki last sem mera kitna hectic tha, itne saare classes, phir upar se Gaurav sir ki extra classes, 4 labs, Enyugma ki website, phir samwaad me juniors ko handle karna, aur phir SIH, aur phir ICPC bhi. Aur din ke akhir me waqt bachta hi nahi tha, lekin phir bhi har din raat ko waqt nikalkar mai Cookie and Nugget ki story likhta tha, sirf isliye ki har din hamare pass baat karne ke liye akhir kuch to ho, aur aksar tumhe gaane bhi bheja karta tha ki din ke akhir me tumhare pass kuch naye gaane ho sunne ke liye. Terko pata hai tere birtday ke waqt college ke bahar mujhe gift wrap nahi mil rahi thi, to usse kharidne ke liye mai tilkamanjhi chala gaya tha. Aur tere birthday ke agle sham mujhe fever tha lekin phir bhi tumhe gift dene ke liye mai academic building tak gaya. Aur kyon? kyonki kisi doosre ko insan ko tum apni koi sabse keemti chiz de sakti ho to wo waqt hai, isiliye maine tumhe apna poora waqt diya, bas yahi dikkat hai mere sath ki mai seedhe seedhe kuch nahi keh pata, lekin baaki har tareeke se maine tumhe batane ki koshish ki. Dekha jaye to mujhe tumhare jitna koi nahi jaanta is college me, tumhe to mere gaano ki playlist tak pata hai yaar, aur iske bawajood sath hi sath tumhe andaaza bhi nahi ki tum mujhe kitni zyada pasand ho. Aur sach kahoon to ab shayad sab khatm ho gaya yaar, akhir me mai sirf ek aisa ladka banke reh jaunga jiske sath tum kuch mahino ke liye dost thi, bas.

               Hi Miku!<br>
               Aur batao kaise ho?<br>
               Well technically its already 31st par kya hi fark padta hai. I hope ki tum bhi abhi tak college pahunch hi gayi hogi. Well kaisi rahi wedding, I hope ki kaafi enjoy kiya hoga. Yaar maine ek baat notice ki hai, ki apan jab bhi college se bahar gaye hai, to sath me hi gaye hai. Like sabse pehli baar last year 26 jan ke waqt, phir october end me, tu ghar gayi thi aur mai maasi ke wedding me, aur third time abb, interesting right? Chalo choro ye baatein, batao kya kya hua wahan par. Chalo pehle mai hi start karta hoon. Apan 24th ko college se nikle the, jaane ke waqt flight se apna arrival time sync nahi ho rah tha to apan train se gaye the first BGP-Howrah then Howrah-kayamkulam. Howrah wali journey itni acchi nahi thi kyonki mere seat ke thik peeche ek pyari si bacchi thi jo poore raste mere seat par laat marte hue gayi thi, uske karan me poori journey so hi nahi paya. Phir howrah me kuch ghante ke liye hum Biraj ki maasi ke ghar ruke the. Unn kuch ghanto me uski maasi ne hame khana khila khila kar hamari halat kharab kar di thi. Phir howrah to kayamkulam wali journey bhi itni kuch khaas nahi rahi, hamare next compartment me hamare hi saath ek aur ICPC ki team jaa rahi thi aur vo theeno poore raaste coding kar rahe the, unhe dekh kar hum depress ho gaye the, ki kahin hum series dekhkar kuch galat to nahi kar rahe. Phir mere thik next seat me ek uncle ji the jinhone apne kharrato se mujhe poore raaste sone nahi diya. At last 26th evening ko apan kayamkulam pahunch gaye. Station se hame pick karne college ki bus aayi thi. Apan campus me enter kiye aur hame realize hua ki actual college campus dikhta kaisa hai. Phir apan ko rooms allocate hue jo ki main building se almost 1km door thi. Hame har samay itni door chalke jaana padta tha, aur raaste me ek nadi aati thi to hame bridge paar karna padta tha aur phir hamara room 5th floor me tha aur building me lift bhi nahi thi, aur majje ki baat to ye hai ki ye sab campus ke andar tha. Baaki sab to thik hi tha 28th ko apna main contest tha aur apan se sirf do hi questions bane. Phir 29th ki subha hum kochi ke liye nikal gaye aur poora din hum city ko jitna explore kar sakte the kiya. Aur phir aaj subah humne Kochi se Hyderabad ki flight li phir airport me khana khaya jo ki kaafi mehenga tha, phir 5 ghante baad hamne doosri flight li patna ki aur abhi 31st ki subah ke 1 baj rahe hain aur mai bhagalpur ki train me hoon. Agar train late nahi hui to subah 5 baje tak pahunch jayenge. Kaafi hectic ho gaya right? Ek aur baat kehni thi, saari me tu bohot sundar lagti hai. Well, kaafi neend aa rahi hai mujhe ab, Bye, kabhi aur baat karenge.<br>

               Hi Miku!<br>
               Yaar ab to ek mahine se bhi zyada ho gaya. Akhiri baar hamari baat 25 dec ko hui thi. Chalo chodo ye saari baatein, ye batao ki kaise ho? Mai to thik hi hoon, aur I guess mera to sab okay okay hi chal raha. Classes kaafi sari hain, aur haan ek interesting baat hai, Abhinav sir thermodynamics chorkar baaki doosre subjects bhi padhate hain, lekin unki class me neend to ab bhi aati hi hai. Terko pata hai kuch din pehle, pehli baar purnendu sir mujhse haskar baat kar rahe the, vo pooch rahe the ki hamara ICPC kaisa gaya, maine kaha ki thik thak gaya par hum next round ke liye qualify nahi kar paye phir unhone kaha ki kamse kaam tumlog wahan tak pahunche to aur phir unhone kaha to nahi par unki aankhen keh rahi thi ki he was very proud of us. I noticed your new glasses, kaafi jach raha hai tumpar.<br>
               Bye, khayal rahkna.

               Aur batao kaise ho?<br>
               Mai to theek hi hoon. Aaj to saari classes cancel ho gayi. Mai subah gaya tha pooja mai actually aur mujhe wahan tum dikh gayi uske sath aur phir najane kyon mai adhe raaste hi lautkar aa gaya. Aisa kai baar hota hai shayad tujhe bhi pata ho par iska ye matlab nahi ki mujhe tujhse koi shikayat hai ya mai tujhse naraz hoon. Par najane kyon tumhe dekhne ke baad me hamesha aise behave karta hoon. I guess ye itni badi baat nahi hai, kuch dinno me thik ho jayega. Waise bhi akhir tum shuru se yahi to chahti thi. Aur mai tumhare liye kaafi khush bhi hoon. Ya I know not the whole of me but a part of me is really happy for you. Aur waise bhi zinta tu usse pasand karti hai utna to shayad mai bhi tujhe nahi karta.<br>
               Bye, khayal rakhna.

               Hi Miku!<br>
               Bahut thak gaya mai aaj, yaar. Pichle do dinno se lagatar poore din acedemic building me hi beet gaya, Phir aaj subha subha Inauguration aur sham ko cultural night, kaafi hectic tha, Par maza bhi aaya. Chalo choro ye sab, ye batao kaise ho? Sabkuch kaisa chal raha. Yaar mera to kuch hi hectic ho gaya hai sab, itna kuch manage hi nahi ho pa raha ek sath, shayad Samwaad ka incharge nahi banna tha mujhe. Waise tune gymkhana ki site me contribute karne se mana kyon kar diya. Yaar, terepe load nahi aata zyada, apan sab milkar bana lete. Chalo choro ye baatein, agle hafte midsem hai, tayyari ho gayi, meri to bilkul nahi hui yaar. Sabne itna kuch padha diya hai, upar se Himadri sir kya padha rahe kuch samajh nahi aa rah.  Lekin baat to ye bhi hai ki pehle bhi kuch kahan samajh aata tha, ummeed hai ki midsems acche jaye. Aur tu bhi chinta matt tere bhi acche hi jayenge. Mai bhi yaar kya faaltu ki baaton me tumhe uljha raha hoon, tumhe padhna bhi hoda, chalo kabhi aur baat karenge. Best of Luck for midsems.<br>

               Hi!<br>
               Well, its 3:40 in the morning now. Pata nahi achanak se aankh khul gayi. Aur ab neend hi nahi aa rahi. I miss those days when I used to wake up and see if you have texted me back. I know that from getting to know someone, to loving them, its such a long journey. And I know you didnt have the emotional capacity to start the whole process again with someone. I guess when we're young, we just believe there'll be many people with whom we'll connect with. And later in life, we realize it only happens a few times. I think it happened to you. That you have met that people of you. And if I am right, if you really have then no matter what happen just dont let him go. I wish that it never happens that you both stop talking to each other. But somehow if it does happen then please remember that, when we loose touch with someone, we just try to store up all the things in our mind that we want to tell them from every big events to every small details and we think that the next time when we will meet I am gonna tell her/him everything, but it just never happen so, right. Because when we finally see each other we either just ignore them or just fake it saying that whatever happened, happened for good. And even if we gather the courage to tell them what we really want to, we just end up talking about big events thinking its too much bother to talk about the little things but its the little things that makes up life, right. I know people say that its never late for anything but trust me it doesnt always work like that. So if you ever loose touch with him and the next time when you meet him then please spill your heart out and tell him what you had been keeping inside you for so long and not because he will be unaware of those things, but because its the right thing to do. And tell him that its his memory that always make you happy whenever you think about it. But just remember whenever you tell him just tell him in person and not in chat. And if you missed anything that you wanted to say then save it for the next time and just spill that out no matter if the topic you are talking in is different cause you know you dont have to be perfect around him and he will understand you anyway.<br>

           Hi!<br>
           I am lying on my bead right now, having a little headache, came back from Varanasi 2 hrs ago. Well if you ask me the past few days was really fun. Well, we left on 28 afternoon, and reached varanasi the morning after. We almost didnt sleep at all that day, took off for Kal bhairav Mandir directly after bath. Then from there we went Kashi Vishwanath Mandir, and waited for 5hrs straight in sunlight, after that we had breakfast or you can say brunch as it was 12noon then. After that we had few juice as it was really hot and then shopped a little and then after that we looked for auto but we didnt get any and had to walk all the way to gurudwara, oh by the way I forget to mention that we stated in Gurudwara, actually paji's father is the secretary of a Gurudwara there so we got VIP rooms. So we slept through the afternoon and went for the Ganga Arti of Dashashwamedh Ghat and it was really beautiful and i just that pretty much cover the our day one.
           The very first thing that we did the next day was breakfast at a roadside stall and their dosa is one of the best that I ever had. And the stall owner turned out to be a really friendly guy, he set us up with a E-Rickshaw that gave us atmost the whole tour of the city. First he took us to Sarnath, where we explored the Dhamekh Stupa and a fascinating museum. Then, off we went to Namo Ghat, we spent a little time there. Next stop was the Ramnagar Fort, followed by a visit to BHU where we checked out the Vishwanath temple. The day continued as we visited the Durga Kund Mandir and then made our way to Assi Ghat, where we had a boat ride from Assi Ghat to Manikarnika Ghat and with that our second day came to an end.
           On the Third day we booked a car and went to Vindhyachal, there we explored three mandirs Vindhyavasini Mandir, Kali khoh Mandir and Ashtabhuja mandir and after that we went for Chunar fort and after that Dev went home and we had our train at evening which got late by 12 hrs so we had to book a room near station. We boarded the train at sunrise and reached college at 4.
           So that was pretty much the zist of our trip, hope you didnt got bored. I wish if I could ever visit those places again with you.<br>

             Hi!<br>
             Eid Mubarak. Well kaafi din ho gaye maine tumhe ek bhi kahani nahi sunai, right. Chalo phir ek sunata hoon aaj.<br>
             <br>
             Well its a story of a girl. The story starts, the girl just woke up.<br>
             She looked at her phone and it was 9.30 in the morning. She had her breakfast, then she was lying on her bed, she didn't had school that day. And then she went out, she had her camera with her, she was obsessed with taking photos, so she went to a nearby river and took few photos, and then she head back. She didn't wanna go home that soon, as she had pretty much nothing to do. While on her way back she stopped by a movie theater and she went to the counter and found out that she is a little short on cash so she took the ticket of the cheapest movie available. She went inside and it was totally empty and there was only one boy at the other corner of the hall.  After few minutes the movie started and it turned out to be a french movie with no subtitles<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - (in loud voice, she called for anyone working in the theater)Hello!, where are the subtitles ?<br>
             (No one responded, but she got the attention of the boy, and after that he stood up and walked straight to her and sat next to her.)<br><br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - You watch, I'll translate.<br>
             (She looked at her suspeciously, he looked at her back.)<br>

             <b>THE GIRL</b> - I think I'm just gonna go tell the theater owner.<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - Ya well you could, but I don't think it will do any good, cause I've seen it before and there's no subtitle.<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - I can get my money back.<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - But its a really good movie, I don't think you want to miss it.<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - Does it have a happy ending?<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - No, definitely not.<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - Okay...<br>
             (And then he started translating)<br>
             <br>
             (The movie was almost three hours long and it had a sad ending so the girl got tears, and after the movie was over she found out that she is holding the boy's hand)
             <br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - I'm sorry. How long was I doing that?<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - I don't know but maybe for an hour I guess.<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - Why didn't you say something ?<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - The movie is a bit of a downer, so..<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - Its a love story..<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - I mean, not all love stories are downers<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - All the good ones are, Romeo and Juliet, La La Land, The English Patient. I think  its the ending of a relationship, that makes a love story so memorable.<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - What about Pride and Prejudice? Jane Eyre? Those both have happy endings.<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - Thats only because the writer chose to end thier love stories prematurely.<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - Wow, that is a really interesting way of not admitting you're wrong.<br>
             (The Girl started laughing)<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - Okay, picture this. Picture that Leonardo Dicaprio didnt die at the end of Titanic<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - Do I have to?<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - Yes, you have to.<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - Jack Dawson is a jobless, penniless gambler, who possessed, at best, marginal artistic talent. <br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - He saved Rose's life<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - Right, of course, But he also love-bombed her and stole her away from her fiance, who obviously was an asshole who did't deserve her. And poor Rose was just so hypnotized by that steamy car sex,  that she thought that he'd give her a life of passionate adventure? I mean come on. That's a life of poverty and ...<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - My god you have really given your thoughts on that, huhh<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - Oh I did.<br><br>
             (A man who works on that theatre comes in and says)<br>
             <b>The Man</b> - Okay, the movie is over...<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - Yaa well okay.<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - So, how did you get so good at speaking French?<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - My dad is a foreign language professor. So he had me fluent in French, Spanish and Italian by the time I was 12.<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - Woww, thats impressive..<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - Yaa, I get that a lot..<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - Really ?<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - No, actually I have never gotten that before.<br> 
             <br><br>
             (they came out of the theater)<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - Well, I should probably..<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - Yea, I too have to go.<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - umm, thank you for letting me whisper in your ear for three hours<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - You are welcome.<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - Bye..<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - Bye<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - Jeremy<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - what?<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - My name. Its Jeremy<br>
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - I'm Melissa<br>
             <b>THE BOY</b> - Maybe I'll see you here again sometime<br> 
             <b>THE GIRL</b> - Yeah. I would like that.<br>
             <br>
             <br>
             (And then they shook hand and he left)<br>

             Do you ever just want to sit next to me and listen to whatever I say, only because you wanna know how my day was? Cause I do.<br>
             Since the day we lost touch, I've been trying to keep track of everything I want to tell you, from every big event to every little thing like what I ate today or what's been on my mind. But I know I will only talk about the big stuff at the end because, you know, it's too hard to go through all the little things. However, these little things are what truly make up life.<br><br>
             It's been 192 days since we lost touch, 536 days since we officially met, and 1654 days since I first saw you. And I still stare at you when you aren't looking. I still compose letters to you in my mind, pouring out my deepest emotions. I still craft playlists filled with songs that remind me of you. And I still plan a date in my head that would never come true.<br><br>
             I tried to tell you all these things in every little way possible, but I guess you failed to notice it. And now it hurts. It hurts everywhere. And I feel nothing and everything at the same time. And I just lie on my bed and look at the ceiling and tell myself, that it's okay. That one day I will still be lying on my bed and I will still be writing and everything will still be the same but it will hurt less and I will think less and the sadness will weigh less and I will finally be able to make peace with the reality and accept it and my heart will finally believe what eyes already see.

             Day 220<br><br>
             I hope you’re well. I know you may never read this, but sometimes, writing is the only solace I have left.<br><br>
             I still remember that time when we had our first conversation, a month after we joined college, when I told how I feel about you, probably coming off as strange or creepy. You must have thought I was out of my mind. But I was just overwhelmed by how much I liked you. It was like the world had stopped for a moment, and all I could see was you. You were quiet most of the time but still you seemed to light up every room you walked into—it was all so captivating. I never imagined that one day I’d be sitting here, pouring my heart out onto these pages, feeling this overwhelming sadness.<br><br>
             We were friends once, good friends. Those days feel like a lifetime ago now. We shared laughs, stories, and moments that I thought would last forever. But somewhere along the way, things changed. I fell for you, harder than I ever thought possible.<br><br>
             When I told you how I felt, it was both the scariest and the most liberating moment of my life. But you were with someone else, and I respected that. I tried to keep my distance, tried to suppress these feelings, but they only grew stronger. Each day, seeing you happy with him, tore me apart a little more. Yet, I couldn't bring myself to hate him, because he made you smile, and that’s all I ever wanted.<br><br>
             As much as it hurt, I valued our friendship too much to risk losing you. But eventually, even that slipped through my fingers. Asking you to block me was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever made. I didn’t want to come between you and your happiness.<br><br>
             It’s been a month now, and not a day goes by when I don’t think about you. The saddest part is that you’re completely unaware of the effect you have on me, the sleepless nights, and the tears that I fight to hold back. I miss you—more than words can express.<br><br>
             I wish things were different. I wish I could go back to the days when we were just friends, when I could see you without this weight in my heart. But I know that’s impossible. I can’t undo what’s been said and done.<br><br>
             I hope you’re happy, truly. I hope he makes you feel as special as you are, and that your days are filled with love and joy. I’ll always carry a piece of you with me, in every beat of my heart and every breath I take. Maybe someday, this pain will fade, and I’ll be able to look back on our time together with a smile instead of tears.<br><br>
             Until then, I’ll keep writing, keep remembering, and keep hoping for a day when the memories of you bring more comfort than sorrow.</p>

             Day 257<br><br>
             Hey its your papa's birthday tomorrow right?<br>
             Well wish him a happy birthday from my side too.<br><br>
             You know why I remember all the things. That the watch you wear is a very close one and that your father gave it to you when you were in 5th. That you really wanted a rose on your last birthday but nobody gave you. Ki tum aksar gaano aur shayariyon me khudko dhundne ki koshish karti ho. Ki tum jitna dikhati ho tumhe usse kayi zyada gussa aata hai, ki tumhare cooler me paani poore 4 mint me bhar jaata hai.<br><br>
             And honestly if you ask me, I am terrible with dates. I mean school me history ke dates mujhe kabhi yaad nahi hue, par phir bhi ab najane kyon mujhe tumhara birthday, tumhare puri family ka birthday aur yahan tak ki tumhare parents ki wedding anniversary tak bhi yaad hai. Aur aisa kyon. Kyonki aisa hi to hota hai, log gaur karte hai. Sab nahi lekin sirf vo jinhe fark padta hai. Tumhare baat karne na karne se nahi but from your existence.<br><br>
             And after all isn't it what everyone desires? To be seen, to have their efforts acknowledged, to be understood, and to be cared for? The only difference here is that you don't look to me for these things.

             Day 262<br><br>
             Hey!<br>
             Dev keh raha tha that you were asking about me. That you still wanna stay friends.<br><br>
             Ab kaise kahoon yaar. I.... well I was just going through some old texts and couldn't help but smile at them. I have realized that asking you to block me was not a great idea I guess. Pata nahi mera mann karta hai ki tujhpar gussa dikhaun, chillaoon tujhpar lekin phir khayal aata hai ki kyon. Akhir teri koi galti hi nahi. Par khash ki hoti kyonki yesab jo mere andar chal raha mujhe ye bahar nikalna hai. Kyon hai zindagi aisi yaar. Kyon nahi chal sakti mere hisab se. Yaar mai tujhe uske sath dekhta hoon to pata nhi kyon mujhe galat sa lagta hai sabhkuch. Vo sapne maine dekhe hai. Ki tu mera hath pakde, ki tu mujhe dekhkar khush ho, apni baatein mujhe batae.... aur ye sari chizen vo jee raha hai aur mai nahi aur mai kuch kar bhi nahi sakta.<br><br>
             I know you want me back as your friend but please smjh yaar, nahi ho payega mujhse, aur himmat nahi hai mujhme. Apne dost banne ke baad mai phirse vahi saari chizen dohrane lagunga, tujhe baar baar text karne lagunga. Tu pareshan ho jayegi mujhse.<br><br>
             The thing is I really miss our conversation and I really miss you. But I respect you and your decisions as well.<br>And I wish you never unblock me.

             Day 265<br><br>
             I've been thinking about what you said, you know to stay friends and I guess I can do that. I mean you once said that I am your only friend with whom you talk poetically so I guess I cant take that away from you. And you asking for friendship is reasonable, and not even listening to you would be a very mean and selfish thing to do.<br><br>
             I cant talk to you in person but we don't need that anyway I guess, because I believe we never really did so, right? I will send you songs on weekends like I used to. And I will tell you about my days if I ever feel low, or maybe I will send you some stories sometimes if you would like that or maybe I will tell anything stupid for no reason.<br>
             I hope this will make up for it.<br><br>
             Or if you also want to talk to me anytime about how your day went or anything thats in your mind then I guess I would love to hear it😊<br><br>

             <b>Chapter 1: The Humble Shop Boy</b><br>
             In the heart of a quaint village, nestled between rolling hills and a sparkling river, there was a small shop owned by Mr. Thompson, a kind and elderly man. His most trusted helper was Liam, a humble and hardworking boy with a heart as pure as gold. Liam’s life was simple—he spent his days stacking shelves, helping customers, and keeping the shop tidy. Despite his modest means, Liam found joy in his work and the people he met every day.

             One day, a girl in a plain dress and a gentle smile walked into the shop. She was unlike anyone Liam had ever seen—graceful and kind, with a warmth that made everyone around her feel at ease. She introduced herself as Sofia, and from that day on, she visited the shop every afternoon, buying small items and chatting with Liam. Her visits became the highlight of Liam’s day, and soon, he found himself looking forward to seeing her more than anything else.

             As the days passed, Liam couldn’t help but notice that his feelings for Sofia were growing stronger. He had never felt this way before, but he was just a simple shop boy, and she seemed so far out of his reach. Still, Liam decided to show her how much she meant to him, even if he couldn’t find the right words.<br>
             Liam began doing small, thoughtful things for Sofia. He would save the freshest fruits for her, offer her flowers he picked on his way to the shop, and even learned to play a few tunes on the flute because she once mentioned how much she loved music. Each time, Sofia would smile, her eyes lighting up with a joy that made Liam’s heart race.

             <b>Chapter 4: The Reason Behind Her Smile</b><br>
             What Liam didn’t know was that Sofia was no ordinary girl—she was the princess of the kingdom, visiting the village in disguise to escape the constraints of palace life. Unlike the courtiers and nobles who surrounded her daily, Liam’s gestures were different. He didn’t know she was a princess, and that made all the difference. Everyone else she knew did things for her because of her royal status, but Liam did them out of the kindness of his heart, simply because he liked her.<br>
             This touched Sofia deeply. She had always longed for someone who would see her for who she truly was, not for her title. Slowly, she found herself falling for Liam, charmed by his sincerity and the way he treated her as a person, not as a princess.

             Just when their bond seemed unbreakable, Sofia stopped coming to the shop. Days turned into weeks, and Liam’s heart grew heavy with worry. He asked around the village, but no one seemed to know where she lived. His thoughts were consumed by her absence, and he feared that he might never see her again.

             One day, while delivering goods to a wealthy merchant’s home, Liam overheard a conversation that made his heart stop. The merchant’s wife was talking about how the king had discovered that Princess Sofia had been sneaking out of the palace in disguise, mingling with commoners. The king, concerned for her safety and reputation, had ordered her to remain within the palace walls.<br>
             Liam realized, with a mix of shock and sadness, that Sofia—the girl he had fallen in love with—was actually the princess. His mind raced with thoughts of how different their lives were. He was just a shop boy, and she was royalty. How could he ever hope to be with her?

             Despite the daunting truth, Liam’s love for Sofia only grew stronger. He couldn’t just forget about her. He decided that the only way to see her again was to find a way into the palace. Liam applied for a job as a servant at the palace, and after weeks of waiting, he was finally hired.<br>
             Working in the palace was much harder than he expected. The rules were strict, and the servants were constantly under supervision. But Liam didn’t care—every moment in the palace was a chance to be close to Sofia. However, the palace was vast, and finding her was no easy task.<br><br>

             <b>Chapter 8: The Forbidden Love</b><br>
             One evening, after weeks of searching, Liam finally caught a glimpse of Sofia in the palace gardens. She was standing by a fountain, looking out over the water, her expression sombre. His heart ached to see her so sad. That night, he slipped a note under her door, pouring out his feelings and revealing that he knew her true identity.<br>
             The next day, Liam found a note waiting for him. It was from Sofia. She wrote about how much she missed him and how she had fallen for him because he was the only one who treated her as a person and not a princess. She explained that her father, the king, had forbidden her from seeing him, but she wished things could be different.

             <b>Chapter 9: The King’s Dilemma</b><br>
             The king, though a wise and kind man, couldn’t let his daughter marry a commoner. He wanted the best for his daughter, and many princes from other kingdoms were coming with offers of marriage. The king thought it was best for the princess to marry someone of her status.<br>
             But Sofia was unhappy. She didn’t want to marry anyone else. She loved Liam, the simple boy who had won her heart with his kindness and love. The king saw his daughter’s sadness and began to worry. He loved her dearly and wanted her to be happy, but he didn’t know how to reconcile his duty with her happiness.

             Liam knew he had to do something quickly before it was too late. He decided that if he could build a good future for himself, maybe the king would allow him to marry the princess. Liam tried many things. He worked harder than ever, saved every penny, and even tried to learn new skills.<br>
             But no matter what he did, he couldn’t seem to change his fate. He was still the same ordinary boy, and the more he tried, the more hopeless he felt. Days turned into weeks, and Liam began to lose hope.

             One evening, as Liam sat outside the shop where he used to work, he saw an old man struggling to carry a heavy bag. Without thinking, Liam rushed to help him. The old man thanked him and asked why Liam looked so sad.<br>
             Liam told the old man everything—about Sofia, the princess, and how he was trying to win the king’s approval but kept failing. The old man listened carefully and then smiled. He told Liam that he was an angel in disguise and that because Liam had helped him, he would grant him one wish.<br><br>

           so I believe you cracked it. I am talking about the code<br>

           najane kyon ab thora alag sa lag raha yaar. isse pehle mujhe lgta tha ki sirf mai hi isse padh rah to mai bindas kuch bhi likh deta tha<br>
           abb jab mujhe pata hai ki you are reading it on the other side to pata nahi mai itna soch kyon raha likhne se pehle.<br>
           but don't worry I will be honest. I know you are reading it only because its raw and you value the honesty.<br>
           lekin haan mai vo date count nahi likh rah ab se. thora ajeeb sa lag raha likhna ab.<br>
           chalo choro ye sab. I believe you must be waiting for the next part of your story. right?<br><br>              
             <b>Chapter 12: The Wish</b><br>
             Liam couldn’t believe what he was hearing. An angel? A wish? It sounded too good to be true. But he had nothing to lose, so he thought carefully about what he wanted. Liam knew he didn’t want riches or power. He just wanted to be worthy of Princess Sofia’s love. <br>
             “I wish to be someone who can make Sofia happy, someone who can stand by her side without shame,” Liam said.<br>
             The angel nodded and granted his wish. In a flash, Liam felt a warmth spread through him. He didn’t feel different on the outside, but something inside him had changed. The angel told him that his true worth would be seen by those who looked with their hearts, not their eyes.<br><br>
             aur ek aur chiz. the bus you gave me was really cute. I will keep it safe

             The next day, Liam went to the palace, feeling a newfound confidence. He requested an audience with the king, and after much persuasion, he was allowed to speak to him.<br>
             Liam spoke from his heart, telling the king about his love for Sofia and how he would do anything to make her happy. The king listened carefully, seeing the sincerity and determination in Liam’s eyes. He saw that Liam’s love was true and pure, and though Liam was still just a simple boy, the king realized that love like this was rare.<br>
             The king, though conflicted, decided to test Liam. He decided to give him a difficult task, something only a person with great character could achieve.<br><br>

            The king listened carefully to Liam’s words and saw the honesty in his eyes. He realized that Liam’s love for Sofia was genuine, but he couldn’t simply allow his daughter to marry a commoner. The king decided to give Liam a task to prove his worth. A task that would test his bravery, wisdom, and character.<br>
            The king instructed Liam to retrieve a rare and magical flower that grew on the highest peak of the Snowy Mountains, far beyond the kingdom’s borders. The flower was said to bloom only once a year, and its petals had the power to heal any wound or illness. Many had tried to find the flower, but none had returned. The king knew that if Liam succeeded, he would prove that he was worthy of the princess’s love<br>
            The king, though conflicted, decided to test Liam. He decided to give him a difficult task, something only a person with great character could achieve.<br><br>
            Accha suno, tum aaj kuch kehna chahti thi kya?<br>
            I mean tum generally rukti nahi class ke baad, but today you did, to mujhe laga ki shayad tumhe kuch kehna ho.<br>
            Aur ye sab jaante hue bhi mai uthke chala gaya🥲. Kitna bura hoon na main. Khair, buri to poori duniya hi hai, to mere bhi bure ho jane se kya hi fark padta hai. Accha isse yaad aaya ki tum shayad uss din kuch aur bhi kehna chahti thi, I am talking about 10th June.<br> 
            Uss din shayad thora gusse me thi tum, najane kyon achanak se tumhare do bde bde messeges aa gaye the. Lekin mujhe pata hai ki whatever you said that day, I don’t think you meant all of it. Because I believe we dont treat people based on what we think about them but rather we treat them on what state of mind we are in. right? I guess tere mann me bhi bahut kuch chal raha tha uss din, par isse pehle ki tum kuch kehti, maine hi tumhe keh diya ki you should block me. Waise meri hi galti hai, mujhe sunn leni chahiye thi tumhari poori baat.<br>
            Chalo choro ye baatein, kaya pata aisa kuch ho hi na. Ki tumhe aaj kuch kehna hi na ho aur tum bas yuhi class ke baad bethi ho, aur mai faltu me hi ye sab kahaniyan bana raha hoon. Waise ye sab normal hai mere liye, mai yoon ulti-seedhi chizen sochta rehta har samay.

            Mai bhi think hi hu. Waise aaj ka din bahut hi unusual tha. Subah uthe to H1 ke gate tak paani aa gaya that, aur seedi bhi doob gyi thi. Thori der me Gaurav Sir, Dheeraj Sir, Prakas Sir sab aa gaye aur hame waha se nikala. Phir hum sabne NBH aakar din bhar bahut masti kari.<br>
            Waise aaj to Atlassian ka OA bhi tha. Hum sab to bahar the aur sirf Krati ke liye 8 bje se pehle aaye. Waise tumhara kaisa gaya?<br> 
            Accha hi gaya hoga. Aur aage ki bhi zyada chinta matt karo yaar, aage bhi badhiya hi jayega, zyada tension matt lo, chill raho, sab sahi hoga.<br>
            Accha haan story ke baare me to mai bhool hi gaya.<br><br>
            <b>Chapter 15: The Perilous Journey</b><br>
            The king knew the task is impossible, he just wanted to know how far Liam would go for his love. Even Liam knew the task was nearly impossible, but he was determined to succeed. He packed a small bag with food and water and set off on his journey.<br> 
            The path to the Snowy Mountains was treacherous, filled with wild animals, deep ravines, and freezing winds. Liam faced many dangers, but he never gave up. He kept thinking of Sofia, her smile, and how much he loved her. That thought gave him the strength to keep going.

            Hi!<br>
            Maaf karna 5 din ho gaye aur maine kuch likha hi nhi.<br>
            Well, actually, I was doing a lot of thinking these days and I was even a little confused about some stuff. But now I guess I am fine.<br>
            Btw I wrote you a poem. Do you wanna hear? Waise to I have written a lot of poems and other stuff but this one I wrote recently so isliye pooch liya ki agr tumhe sunna ho.<br>
            Chalo choro kya hi sunogi. Waise bhi itni acchi hai bhi nhi ki kisiko sunai jaye.<br>
            So tell me, how are you? I mean abhi to classes bhi nhi chal rhi to shayad kuch to alag ho rha hoga. sketching?? maybe dancing?? aur maybe playing guitar?? hmm? kuch nhi chal rha?🫤😕 Agar meri baat kri jaye to yaar kaafi boring sa lg rha. I mean kuch zyada hi. Subah late se uthta hoon. Fir poora din yuhi beet jaata hai. Kuch pata hi nhi chalta. Waise dekha jaye to hum rojj sirf meri hi baat rte hai. Agar tumhare pass kuch hai to sanao.<br>
            Chalo rehne do mai hi sunata hoon. Terko yaad hai? Pichle saal aaj ke hi din, pehli baar hum class mein saath baithe the. Actually 26th september ko. Agar sach kahoon to kaafi himmat lagi thi yaar uss din. uss din se pehle bhi najane kitni baar koshish ki thi maine. Aur jab finally tere paas aake baitha, toh itna nervous tha ki poora waqt meri left leg kaanp rahi thi. I mean, I was literally shaking the entire time! and even my heart was racing so fast. Merko to yaad bhi nhi ki najane kya kya kaha tha maine terko uss din. But I remember that you were in your pink thirt that day. Aur haan tumne ussi din kaha tha ki the watch you wear was given by your Dad when your were in 5th standard. Aur merko to ab bhi yakin nhi ho raha ki terko apne laptop ka model no. tak yaad hai. Terko nhi lgta that a year ago everything was so different, and now when I look back, I realize that a year can do a lot to someone's life.<br><br>
            I dont know I went to bed around 2:30 and suddenly woke up around 4. aur ab najane kyon neend hi nahi aa rhi to socha tumse thori baatein karlu and see its almost 5 now. Everyday, I stay awake till 2 but I dont really study during this time. I generally write or sketch. But mostly I wait, because a part of me wonders ki kya pata agar tum kabhi pareshan ya dukhi ho, halaki mai kabhi nhi chahunga ki aisa kuch bhi ho tumhare sath. But just in case, if you're lost in your thoughts, overthinking, or feeling upset and you couldnt sleep and you decide to reach out, then I want to be here. So I wait, so I don't miss it if you need me.<br>
            Looks like it's finally time for the story. Sorry to keep you waiting.<br><br>
            
            <b>Chapter 16: The Enchanted Forest</b><br>
            As Liam neared the mountains, he entered a dense forest that seemed almost magical in its own way. The trees were tall and ancient, their branches forming a canopy that blocked out most of the sunlight. The air was filled with the sounds of rustling leaves and distant bird calls.<br>
            In the heart of the forest, Liam came across a wide river with strong currents, making it impossible to cross directly. Just as he was beginning to lose hope, he noticed a small wooden bridge partially hidden by overgrown vegetation. The bridge looked old and rickety, but it was his only option.<br>
            With careful steps, Liam began to cross the bridge. Halfway across, the wooden planks beneath him started to creak and splinter. Suddenly, the bridge gave way, and Liam fell into the river with a splash. The cold water shocked him, and the strong current began to pull him downstream.<br>
            Panicking for a moment, Liam spotted a large wooden log floating nearby. Gathering his strength, he swam towards it and managed to grab hold. Using the log as support, he floated down the river, guiding himself with the current until he reached the riverbank.<br>
            Exhausted but relieved, Liam climbed out of the water, dripping wet but undeterred. He knew that the journey ahead would be filled with challenges, but his determination to find the magical flower and prove his worth only grew stronger.<br><br>

I shouldn’t have brought it up. You’re probably just listening to it yourself and decided to put it on your note. I'm sorry I asked it.

            Liam finally reached the base of the Snowy Mountains. The peak was high above, shrouded in clouds and snow. The climb was gruelling, and the cold winds cut through him like a knife. Liam’s hands were numb, and his feet ached, but he kept going. He knew that Sofia was waiting for him, and that thought kept him warm.<br>
            After days of climbing, Liam finally reached the summit. There, on a small patch of snow-covered ground, he saw the magical flower. It was more beautiful than anything he had ever seen, with petals that shimmered in the light. Liam carefully picked the flower, knowing that he had completed the king’s task.

            The king was amazed that Liam had succeeded where so many others had failed. He took the flower and saw the determination and love in Liam’s eyes. The king knew then that Liam was no ordinary boy—he was a man of great courage and character, worthy of his daughter’s love.

            Hi!<br>
            Aur batao? Kaisa chal raha sab? SAI kaisa gya kl tumhara? Agar hamara pooch to ok-ok hi gaya. Sunil sir baar baar yhi keh rhe the ki copy kiya hai tumne lekin Chetan Sir ko kaafi pasand aaya hamra project. Par kya hi fark pdta hai, akhir me unhe last baar ki tarah hi marking krni hai. Ki jisko vo naam se jaante hai unhe acche grade aur baakiyon ko bure😔.<br>
            Chalo choro, baaki sb kaisa chal rha batao. Mere to kuch sahi nhi chal rha yaar, chetan sir ne itne marks kaat liye, pata nhi kya ho gaya hai unhe, 4 credit ka subject hai aur najane kyon aisa kr rhe. Aur baaki dusri chizon ka to poocho mtt. Rehne do yaar nhi krte in chizon pr baatein, sirf mann kharab hi hona hai inse. Chalo ek kahani sunata hoon.<br>
            You know when I was in my elementary school, I used to live in a flat on the front building of our school. I mean mere ghar aur school ke beech sirf 10-15 kadam ki ek sadak thi bass. To mai kabhi school ke liye late nhi hota tha. Aur har roz hamari classes khatm hone ke baad me hamare school ke entrance gate ko pakadke khada ho jata tha, aur mumma ke aane ka wait krta tha. Aur muuma rozz balcony me khade rehti thi aur bolti thi beta aa jao, aur agar darr lg rah to gaurd ko boldo vo sadk paar kara dega. Pr mai phir bhi nhi aata tha aur bolta rehta ki nhi mumma aap aao, sirf isliye kyonki merko icecream khani hoti thi dukaan se😁😁. Kayi baar jb vo mana kr deti thi icecream dilane se to mai sadak me lotna shuru kr deta tha. Mumma bahot khidti thi mere iss hrkat se😅😅.<br>
            Agar sach kahoon to mai tumhare baare me jo bhi kehta hoon, ya sochta hoon, unka koi matlab hai hi nhi, right? Kyonki dekha jaye to mai tumhare baare me kuch jaanta hi nhi. Like how your school was, aur tumhara bachpan kaisa rha, tumhe konsi jagah bahut pasand hai, tumhara bestfriend kon hai. Ye sab to phir bhi door ki baat hai, mujhe to ye tak nhi pata ki tumhe kin baaton se bura lgta hai, ya phir tumhara favourite food kya hai. Kyonki sbse zyada to yahi important hai na? baatein aur khana. Dekha jaye to mujhe jo bhi pata hai ya mai jo tumhare baare me sochta hoon unhe sirf maine assume hi kiya hai, waise schme hai ki nhi iss baat ka to pata hi nhi.<br>
            chalo chro yaar.<br>

            <b>CHAPTER 1: THE BONDS</b><br>
            Aarav, Meera, and Rohan had been best friends since they met in college. Their friendship was strong and admired by others—full of laughter, support, and countless shared experiences. They had faced exams, celebrated victories, and navigated ordinary days together, forming a close-knit trio.<br>
            But beneath the surface of their seemingly perfect friendship, things were more complicated. Aarav 
            harboured a deep, unspoken love for Meera. It was a quiet feeling that connected his heart to hers in 
            ways he couldn't fully understand. This silent bond brought him comfort, but also pain.<br>
            Meera appreciated Aarav's calm and steady presence. He was always there to listen and support her 
            without judgment. Aarav's quiet strength was a source of comfort for Meera, even if she never fully 
            realized the extent of his feelings.<br>
            Rohan, on the other hand, brought a different kind of energy into Meera's life. His extroverted nature 
            and enthusiasm turned ordinary days into adventures. Rohan's presence was electrifying, filling their 
            lives with excitement. With him, Meera felt alive in a way that was both thrilling and comforting. Their 
            relationship was passionate and intense, filled with ups and downs but unmistakably full of love.<br>
            Aarav’s role in their relationship was both supportive and painful. He was genuinely happy for Meera, 
            but seeing her with Rohan—laughing, holding hands, and sharing private jokes—was a bittersweet 
            reminder of his unspoken love. He had come to accept that Meera was happy with Rohan, and that was 
            enough for him. Or at least, he tried to convince himself of that.<br>
            On days when the city outside seemed so lively, Aarav felt his emotions more deeply. He would often 
            find himself lost in thought, replaying moments with Meera and the “what-ifs” that would never happen. 
            He imagined how things might have been different if he had been brave enough to speak his heart.<br>
            One evening, Aarav decided to take a walk to clear his mind. The streets were busy with people enjoying 
            the warm summer evening. He found himself at a familiar café where he and Meera had spent many 
            moments together. He walked in, hoping a change of scenery might ease his troubled thoughts.<br>
            The café was cozy, filled with the smell of coffee and the murmur of conversation. Aarav noticed Rohan 
            and Meera sitting at a corner table, absorbed in each other. Rohan was animatedly talking, while Meera 
            listened with a smile.<br>
            Aarav hesitated at the entrance, feeling like an intruder. But before he could leave, Meera spotted him 
            and smiled warmly.<br>
            “Aarav! Over here!” Meera called, waving him over.<br>
            Rohan looked up and smiled. “Hey, buddy! Join us.”<br>
            Aarav forced a smile and walked over to their table, trying to shake off the sadness in his chest. He sat 
            down and greeted them. “Hey, you two. What’s up?”<br>
            Rohan began telling a story. “So, I told them, ‘If you want it done right, you’ve got to do it yourself!’” he 
            said, his hands gesturing as he spoke. “And you should’ve seen their faces!”<br>
            Meera laughed, her eyes bright with amusement. “You always have the best stories, Rohan. I don’t know 
            how you come up with them.”<br>
            Aarav sat quietly, enjoying their company despite the lingering sadness. Their laughter was both 
            comforting and painful, reminding him of the love he couldn’t fully express.<br>
            When Rohan stepped away to take a call, Meera and Aarav were left alone at the table. The silence 
            between them was soft but heavy.<br>
            “How have you been, Aarav?” Meera asked gently.<br>
            Aarav looked at his coffee, struggling to find the right words. “I’ve been… alright. Just busy.”<br>
            Meera looked at him closely. “You seem a bit distracted. Everything okay?”<br>
            Aarav forced a smile, feeling the weight of his emotions. “Yeah, just a lot on my mind.”<br>
            Meera reached out and placed a hand on his. “If you ever need to talk, I’m here for you. You know that, 
            right?”<br>
            Her gesture was a small comfort, a reminder of their deep bond, even with his unspoken love. Aarav 
            nodded, feeling a lump in his throat. “Thanks, Meera. I appreciate it.”<br>
            Before the conversation could go deeper, Rohan returned. The mood lightened, and they resumed 
            discussing their weekend plans.<br>
            Later, as Aarav walked home alone, he thought about the day. The café had reminded him of the invisible 
            bonds that connected them—shared laughter, unspoken understanding, and the quiet pain of his own 
            feelings. Watching Meera and Rohan, he felt a mix of admiration and longing. Their happiness was 
            intertwined with his silent sacrifice.<br>
            Aarav found peace in accepting his role in their lives. He was content with being a quiet supporter, 
            cherishing the moments he had while carrying his unspoken love gracefully. The quiet of his room 
            mirrored the calm acceptance he felt within—a silent acknowledgment of his heartache and the joy he 
            found in seeing Meera happy.<br>
            With a deep breath, Aarav closed his eyes, finding solace in the unseen bonds that connected them all.

            <b>CHAPTER 2: THE WEIGHT OF SILENCE</b><br>
            The trio had planned a getaway to the hills, a refreshing change from the city’s constant buzz. Rohan, 
            always full of energy and eager for adventure, suggested the trip, and Meera eagerly agreed. Aarav, 
            though hesitant, joined them, hoping that the peaceful surroundings might help him sort through his 
            tangled feelings. As they drove through the winding roads and lush landscapes, Aarav found himself lost 
            in thought, feeling a heavy silence within.<br>
            The guesthouse they arrived at was charming and cozy, nestled in a quiet part of the hills. Rohan’s 
            enthusiasm shone through as he greeted the staff with his usual warmth, making friends quickly. He 
            eagerly began planning their activities to make sure Meera had the best time.<br>
            Meera, with her calm and thoughtful nature, let Rohan take charge. She enjoyed his excitement and 
            added her own suggestions, balancing his energy with her serene presence.<br>
            Aarav watched from the sidelines, feeling like an outsider. He joined in their conversations and laughed 
            at Rohan’s jokes, but despite the stunning mountain views and his friends’ company, he felt a deep sense 
            of isolation. The beauty of nature did little to ease the confusion in his heart.<br>
            During a hike along a scenic trail, Rohan and Meera walked ahead, chatting and laughing. Aarav lagged 
            behind, appreciating the beauty around.<br>
            When they stopped to rest, Rohan lay back on a grassy knoll, stretching with a satisfied sigh. “This is 
            perfect,” he said, looking at the panoramic view. “I’ve always loved the mountains. They make me feel 
            so free.”<br>
            Meera sat beside him, her eyes reflecting the serenity of the surroundings. “It’s beautiful. I’m really glad 
            we came.”<br>
            Aarav, sitting against a tree a bit away, listened to them. Their happiness seemed distant to him, like he 
            was watching from another world.<br>
            As the sun set, casting a golden light over everything, Meera turned to Aarav. “How are you finding the 
            trip? Are you having a good time?”<br>
            Aarav with a smile. “It’s great. The scenery is amazing.”<br>
            Meera looked at him closely, sensing something was wrong. “You seem a bit off. Is everything okay?”<br>
            Aarav hesitated. “I’m just... taking it all in. It’s a lot to process.”<br>
            Rohan, overhearing, jumped in with a grin. “Come on, Aarav, don’t be so serious. We’re here to have 
            fun. Let’s explore more before dinner.”<br>
            They continued their hike, Rohan’s enthusiasm a welcome distraction. They discovered a hidden 
            waterfall, and Rohan eagerly encouraged Meera and Aarav to join him near the water.<br>
            As they stood by the waterfall, Meera’s joy was clear. She laughed as Rohan playfully splashed water at 
            her, her laughter echoing in the calm air. Aarav watched from a distance.<br>
            Later, back at the guesthouse, they gathered around a fireplace. The warmth was a comfort against the 
            cool mountain air. They talked about their day, sharing stories and planning their next adventure.<br>
            Rohan noticed Aarav’s quietness and looked at him with concern. “Hey, Aarav, you’ve been really quiet 
            tonight. Anything on your mind?”<br>
            Aarav met Rohan’s gaze. “Just thinking about stuff. Nothing major.”<br>
            Meera placed a gentle hand on his shoulder. “If you want to talk, we’re here for you. Sometimes sharing 
            can help.”<br>
            Aarav appreciated their concern but struggled to find the words. The thought of opening up about his 
            feelings was overwhelming. He gave a nod and a grateful smile. “Thanks, I’ll be alright.”<br>
            As the night went on, Aarav retreated to his room, seeking solace in solitude. He sat by the window, 
            looking out at the starlit sky. The silence of the mountains felt different from the chaos in his heart.<br>
            He thought about the day—the stunning landscape, the joy of his friends, and everything else. He had 
            hoped the trip would help him find peace, but the weight of his feelings seemed to follow him.<br>
            Lying down to sleep, Aarav embraced the quiet of the night. He knew his feelings for Meera were a 
            constant presence in his life, an unspoken burden he carried. The hills had provided a beautiful escape, 
            but they also highlighted the distance between his heart and the happiness he longed for.<br>

            <b>CHAPTER 3: MOMENTS OF SOLITUDE</b><br>
            One evening, as the sun set and painted the sky with shades of orange and pink, Aarav felt a familiar restlessness. The day had been full of laughter and exploration with Meera and Rohan, but as the sky darkened, he longed for a moment alone. Quietly, he slipped out of the guesthouse, careful not to wake his friends.<br>
            He chose a path that led through a small forest, a peaceful escape from the day's busy activities. The tall trees stood like silent guardians, and the air was cool, filled with the scent of pine and fresh earth. Aarav walked slowly, letting the calm of the forest wash over him.<br>
            As he walked, his thoughts wandered back to memories of Meera. He recalled their friendship, their shared laughter, and the times he almost told her how he felt. The words were always on his mind, but fear held him back. He feared losing her or upsetting the balance of their friendship. So, he kept his feelings hidden, behind walls of silence.<br>
            Aarav found a small clearing, a quiet spot away from the world. He sat on a large rock, leaning against a tree. The view was beautiful—rolling hills bathed in the soft light of the setting sun, and the sky a mix of colors. He sighed deeply, feeling the weight of his emotions.<br>
            The vastness around him only made his loneliness feel sharper. He had always enjoyed his own company, but this loneliness was different—more painful. It hurt to see Meera and Rohan laughing together, to feel excluded from their joy. The solitude that once felt like comfort now felt like a cage.<br>
            He stared at the horizon, thinking about Meera. He wondered if he’d ever find the courage to tell her how he felt. The thought of confessing his love was frightening, with the risk of rejection and losing her friendship. So, he chose to stay silent, hiding behind his emotional barriers.<br>
            As the sun set and stars began to appear, the forest grew quiet, with only crickets chirping. Aarav closed his eyes, letting the sounds of nature calm him.<br>
            His thoughts turned to happy moments with Meera and Rohan. He remembered their college days—Meera’s excited eyes, Rohan’s laughter. Their friendship was a comfort, even if it couldn’t erase his unspoken love.<br>
            Aarav wondered if there would ever be a moment when he could be honest about his feelings without losing everything. The forest offered no answers, only quiet peace.<br>
            Eventually, Aarav stood up, brushing off the dirt from his pants. He took one last look at the serene landscape before heading back to the guesthouse. The walk back seemed shorter, the night air cool against his skin. The solitude had given him space to reflect on his emotions.<br>
            Back at the guesthouse, the soft lamp light was a comforting contrast to the cold clarity of the forest. Aarav entered his room and sat by the window, gazing out at the darkened hills. The peaceful night reminded him that despite his struggles, the world kept turning.

            <b>CHAPTER 4: THE PUSH AND PULL</b><br>
            Back at the guesthouse, Rohan and Meera sat on the porch, enjoying the cool evening breeze. The sun had set, leaving a sky full of stars. Rohan was animatedly sharing one of his many funny stories, and Meera’s laughter filled the quiet night. There was a natural ease between them—Rohan’s lively energy matched perfectly with Meera’s quieter, thoughtful nature.<br>
            Despite their comfortable interaction, Meera couldn’t shake a growing unease. Aarav had been distant lately, and it felt different this time. She missed their easy conversations and the silent understanding they had always shared.<br>
            As Rohan continued his story, Meera’s thoughts drifted back to Aarav. She remembered how he had seemed withdrawn during their hike and the way he had looked away by the waterfall. She couldn’t help but feel worried.<br>
            Rohan noticed her distraction and gently squeezed her hand. “What’s on your mind?” he asked softly.<br>
            Meera gave a small smile and squeezed his hand back. “I’ve been thinking about Aarav. He’s been really quiet lately.”<br>
            Rohan’s expression turned thoughtful. He understood how important Aarav was to Meera. “Maybe he’s just enjoying some quiet time,” Rohan suggested. “You know he likes his alone time.”<br>
            “Yeah, maybe,” Meera said, though her voice carried uncertainty. “But it feels different this time. I hope he’s okay.”<br>
            Rohan put his arm around her, pulling her close. “He’s probably fine, Meera. He just needs a bit of space. You know how he is.”<br>
            Meera leaned her head on Rohan’s shoulder, comforted by his presence but still worried. Aarav was more than a friend to her; he was someone she deeply cared about. His withdrawal made her anxious, and she felt like there was something he wasn’t sharing.<br>
            Rohan continued with his stories, trying to distract Meera from her worries. Even as he spoke, Meera’s mind kept returning to Aarav. She remembered the quiet times they had shared, moments when their silence had meant a lot. Aarav had always been there for her, and she wanted to be there for him too. She just wasn’t sure how to reach out.<br>
            After a while, Rohan noticed Meera’s continued preoccupation. “You know,” he said, “if you’re worried about Aarav, maybe you should talk to him. He might open up if you ask.”<br>
            Meera considered this. She didn’t want to let their friendship slip away. Confronting him was intimidating, but Rohan’s advice made her realize she needed to address her concerns.<br>
            “You’re right,” Meera said, her resolve growing. “I should talk to him. I just don’t want to push him if he’s not ready.”<br>
            Rohan nodded, understanding her hesitation. “Just approach him gently. Let him know you’re there for him and that you’re ready to listen.”<br>
            Meera smiled at Rohan, grateful for his support. “Thanks, Rohan. I’ll find a way to talk to him. I hope he’ll be open with me.”<br>
            Rohan smiled back and gave her a soft kiss on the forehead. “He will be. He trusts you.”<br>
            As the night grew darker, Rohan and Meera continued their conversation, shifting to lighter topics. Even so, Meera’s thoughts were still on Aarav. She resolved to reconnect with him and offer her support.<br>
            Later, as Meera prepared for bed, her mind was full of thoughts about Aarav. She knew she needed to reach out soon and offer him the help he might need. Balancing her love for Rohan and her concern for Aarav was challenging, but she was determined to handle it with care.<br>
            As she drifted off to sleep, Meera hoped she could bridge the gap that had formed with Aarav and preserve their important friendship.

            <b>CHAPTER 5: THE DANCE OF HEARTS</b><br>
            The next day, Rohan was buzzing with excitement. “How about we hike to that viewpoint I told you about?” he suggested, his eyes bright with enthusiasm. “The view is supposed to be incredible!”<br>
            Meera’s face lit up. “That sounds amazing! I’m in.”<br>
            Aarav, despite feeling torn inside, nodded. “I’m up for it.”<br>
            The trail to the viewpoint was known for being tough, but the promise of stunning views made it worth the effort. Rohan, full of energy, led the way, chatting about past hikes and pointing out interesting sights.<br>
            Aarav fell behind a bit, using the hike as a way to clear his mind. The rhythm of his footsteps and the sound of the wind through the trees helped him forget his troubles, if only for a little while.<br>
            Meera noticed Aarav struggling and slowed her pace to stay with him. “Hey, you okay back there?” she asked softly, her concern evident.<br>
            Aarav looked up, surprised by her attention. He managed a weak smile. “Yeah, just taking it slow.”<br>
            Meera watched him closely, sensing the sadness he was trying to hide. She didn’t push him to talk but stayed by his side, offering silent support.<br>
            Rohan, still ahead, reached the top first. He turned and waved, “Come on, slowpokes! You don’t want to miss this view!”<br>
            Meera and Aarav exchanged a quick look and quickened their pace. Despite his internal struggle, Aarav felt a small spark of warmth at Rohan’s excitement. They pushed on together, determined to see the view Rohan had raved about.<br>
            The final stretch of the trail was steep, but the sight at the top made it all worthwhile. The valley spread out before them in a sweeping view of green and gold, with a river cutting through like a ribbon. The sky was a brilliant blue, dotted with fluffy clouds.<br>
            The beauty was breathtaking. For a moment, Aarav felt a sense of peace, as if his worries were small compared to the vast landscape before him. But as he watched Meera and Rohan interact—sharing smiles and tender gestures—his sense of peace began to fade.<br>
            Rohan, in his usual enthusiastic way, pulled Meera close, wrapping an arm around her. They seemed so happy together, and Aarav felt like an outsider, standing apart and watching.<br>
            Meera noticed Aarav’s distance and called out, “Aarav, come over here. You have to see this from this angle.”<br>
            Aarav forced a smile and joined them, standing slightly aside. He tried to focus on the view, but his mind was tangled with emotions.<br>
            As the sun set, painting the sky with oranges and pinks, Rohan was excited about the stars. “The sky’s going to be amazing tonight. We should stay and watch the stars.”<br>
            Meera looked at Aarav. “What do you think? Are you up for staying?”<br>
            Aarav hesitated, then nodded. “Sure, I’ll stay.”<br>
            They found spots to sit and enjoy the changing colors of the sky. Rohan’s excitement about the stars was in stark contrast to Aarav’s subdued mood. Meera tried to engage Aarav in conversation, but he remained distant, his replies short and unenthusiastic.<br>
            As darkness fell and stars began to appear, Rohan eagerly pointed out constellations. “Did you know Orion’s Belt is one of the most recognizable patterns in the night sky?”<br>
            Meera glanced at Aarav, hoping to spark his interest. “Orion’s Belt is really beautiful. Have you ever wondered about the stories behind the stars?”<br>
            Aarav forced another smile and nodded. “Yeah, it’s amazing.”<br>
            As the night wore on, Aarav’s loneliness returned. The stars twinkled above, indifferent to his pain, while the closeness of Meera and Rohan was a bittersweet reminder of what he longed for but could never fully reach.

            Meera noticed Aarav’s distance and called out, “Aarav, come over here. You have to see this from this angle.”<br>
            Aarav forced a smile and joined them, standing slightly aside. He tried to focus on the view, but his mind was tangled with emotions.<br>
            As the sun set, painting the sky with oranges and pinks, Rohan was excited about the stars. “The sky’s going to be amazing tonight. We should stay and watch the stars.”<br>
            Meera looked at Aarav. “What do you think? Are you up for staying?”<br>
            Aarav hesitated, then nodded. “Sure, I’ll stay.”<br>
            They found spots to sit and enjoy the changing colors of the sky. Rohan’s excitement about the stars was in stark contrast to Aarav’s subdued mood. Meera tried to engage Aarav in conversation, but he remained distant, his replies short and unenthusiastic.<br>
            As darkness fell and stars began to appear, Rohan eagerly pointed out constellations. “Did you know Orion’s Belt is one of the most recognizable patterns in the night sky?”<br>
            Meera glanced at Aarav, hoping to spark his interest. “Orion’s Belt is really beautiful. Have you ever wondered about the stories behind the stars?”<br>
            Aarav forced another smile and nodded. “Yeah, it’s amazing.”<br>
            As the night wore on, Aarav’s loneliness returned. The stars twinkled above, indifferent to his pain, while the closeness of Meera and Rohan was a bittersweet reminder of what he longed for but could never fully reach.

            <b>CHAPTER 6: THE WORDS UNSAID</b><br>
            The evening at the guesthouse was winding down as the sun set, casting a soft glow over everything. The trio had gathered around a crackling campfire near the guesthouse. The warmth of the fire contrasted with the cool night air, creating a cozy atmosphere.<br>
            Rohan, ever the initiator of fun, suggested a game. “How about we play ‘Truth or Dare’? It’s been a while since we did something like that.”<br>
            Meera’s eyes lit up with amusement. “Sure, that sounds fun!”<br>
            Aarav, though hesitant, didn’t want to dampen the mood. He reluctantly agreed, with a small, forced smile. “Alright, but let’s keep the dares reasonable.”<br>
            The game started with light questions and dares. Meera and Rohan took turns asking playful questions and issuing harmless challenges. Aarav joined in but couldn’t shake off the heaviness of his thoughts.<br>
            As the night went on, the game became more intimate. The fire crackled, and the shadows around them grew darker and more mysterious. The playful atmosphere gave way to something more serious.<br>
            It was Aarav’s turn, and Rohan, with a mischievous grin, asked, “Alright, Aarav, truth or dare?”<br>
            Aarav, wary of bold dares, chose “Truth.”<br>
            Rohan’s grin widened. “If you could change one thing about your life right now, what would it be?”<br>
            The question struck Aarav deeply. It felt as though Rohan had touched on something he wasn’t ready to face. Aarav’s heart raced, and he felt a lump in his throat. He glanced briefly at Meera, who was watching him with concern, before looking away.<br>
            Aarav took a deep breath. “I would... I would tell someone how I really feel,” he said quietly. His gaze flickered to Meera for a moment before he looked down, unable to meet her eyes.<br>
            The words hung in the air, heavy with meaning. Meera’s eyes widened slightly, her brows furrowing. She sensed that Aarav’s revelation was more than just a game; it was something deeper.<br>
            Rohan, sensing the mood shift, tried to lighten things up. “Alright, your turn, Meera,” he said, trying to steer the game back to its original tone.<br>
            Meera, though unsettled by Aarav’s confession, picked up the game with a forced smile. She chose “Truth” and answered Rohan’s questions with a mix of honesty and light-heartedness. The laughter returned, but the weight of Aarav’s words lingered.<br>
            As the night wore on and the fire began to die, the group sat in a reflective silence. Meera turned to Aarav, her eyes filled with concern.<br>
            “Aarav,” she began gently, “I’ve been thinking about what you said earlier. Is there something you want to talk about?”<br>
            Aarav, surprised by her question, looked at her with apprehension. “Meera, it’s nothing. I didn’t mean to—”<br>
            Meera cut him off softly. “No, it’s not nothing. You’ve been distant lately, and I’m worried. If there’s something bothering you, you can talk to me.”<br>
            Aarav’s heart ached. He wanted to open up, to share his burden, but fear of disrupting their friendship held him back. “I... I appreciate that, Meera. Really. It’s just... complicated.”<br>
            Rohan, sensing the tension, decided to step in. “Hey, how about we call it a night? We’ve had a long day, and it’s probably time to get some rest.”<br>
            Meera looked at Rohan, then back at Aarav. She nodded reluctantly, though her concern was still evident. “Alright, let’s head back.”<br>
            The trio walked back to the guesthouse, the mood subdued compared to earlier. Aarav walked silently, his mind swirling with emotions. The game had unearthed feelings he wasn’t ready to confront, and the weight of unspoken words pressed heavily on him.<br>
            As they reached their rooms, Meera hesitated before saying goodnight. “Aarav, if you change your mind, I’m here. Anytime.”<br>
            Aarav offered a faint smile, his eyes reflecting his inner struggle. “Thanks, Meera. I’ll think about it.”<br>
            Meera and Rohan went to their room, leaving Aarav alone with his thoughts. He sat by the window, staring out into the night, the stars above silent witnesses to his turmoil. The fire’s warmth was replaced by the cool, quiet night, and Aarav felt the weight of his emotions pressing down on him.<br>
            He knew he couldn’t keep hiding forever. The unspoken words, the feelings he had buried, were demanding to be heard. But for now, all he could do was wait, hoping that someday he would find the courage to speak up and share his heart with the people who mattered most.

            <b>CHAPTER 7: THE HIDDEN TRUTH</b><br>
            The next morning, the guesthouse was quiet and peaceful. The mist had cleared, revealing a bright day. Meera, still troubled by the events of the previous night, decided she needed to talk to Aarav.<br>
            She found him by the small pond near the guesthouse. He was sitting alone, tossing pebbles into the water and watching the ripples spread out. The calm scene was a sharp contrast to the storm of emotions inside him.<br>
            “Mind if I join you?” Meera asked softly, her voice barely disturbing the stillness of the morning.<br>
            Aarav looked up, his surprise quickly giving way to a resigned acceptance. “Sure, sit down.”<br>
            Meera sat down beside him, and they both watched the ripples in silence. Meera could feel the heaviness of the conversation that needed to happen.<br>
            “Yesterday,” Meera began cautiously, breaking the silence with a voice that trembled slightly, “when you said you’d tell someone how you really feel... were you talking about something specific?”<br>
            Aarav’s heart raced. He had been dreading this moment. “I was talking about... about my feelings,” he admitted quietly, his gaze fixed on the pebbles scattered at his feet.<br>
            Meera’s heart sank. She had sensed something deeper, but hearing it out loud was different. “Your feelings for whom?” she asked, though part of her was bracing for the answer.<br>
            Aarav took a deep breath. “For you, Meera.”<br>
            The words hung in the air. Meera stared at Aarav, her heart aching. She had always known Aarav cared for her, but she hadn’t realized the depth of his feelings. The revelation was both painful and revealing.<br>
            “I didn’t know,” Meera said softly, her voice barely above a whisper. “I never meant to... I didn’t realize you felt this way.”<br>
            Aarav looked away, his face full of regret. “I didn’t want to say anything. I was afraid it would ruin our friendship. It’s been so hard, keeping it all inside.”<br>
            Meera reached out, placing a comforting hand on his arm. “Aarav, I’m so sorry. I had no idea. I never wanted to hurt you.”<br>
            Aarav gave a weak smile. “You haven’t hurt me. I’ve been the one holding it all in. It’s my own fault.”<br>
            “No,” Meera said firmly, shaking her head. “It’s not your fault. I wish I had known earlier. I care about you a lot, Aarav. You’re an important part of my life.”<br>
            The air between them grew thick with emotion. Meera’s heart was heavy with a mix of guilt and sympathy, while Aarav felt a bittersweet relief. The burden of his unspoken feelings was now out in the open, but the truth brought with it a new set of challenges.<br>
            The silence that followed was filled with unspoken feelings and questions. Meera felt torn as she tried to understand her emotions with this new information. Aarav, though glad he had shared his feelings, was unsure about what would happen next in their relationship.<br>
            After a few moments of silence, Meera spoke again, her voice soft but resolute. “Aarav, I need some time to think about this. I hope you understand.”<br>
            Aarav nodded, understanding the need for space. “Of course, Meera. Take all the time you need.”<br>
            They stood up and dusted off their clothes. The conversation had brought them closer in an emotional sense but left them with much to think about. As they walked back to the guesthouse, the weight of their talk lingered.<br>
            The rest of the day felt subdued. The excitement of their previous adventures seemed distant compared to the heavy conversation they had shared. Both Aarav and Meera were lost in their own thoughts, trying to understand the new dynamics of their friendship.<br>
            The hidden truth had been revealed, and with it, the realization that their relationships were about to change. The future was uncertain, but it was clear that they needed to navigate their evolving emotions with care.

            <b>CHAPTER 8: THE UNSPOKEN CHANGE</b><br>
            After Aarav's heartfelt confession, things between the friends started to feel different. The ease and comfort they once shared now seemed strained and awkward. The warmth that had always defined their friendship was overshadowed by the new, complicated feelings.<br>
            Meera, despite trying to be supportive, felt the weight of Aarav’s confession. She tried to keep things normal, but the tension was hard to ignore. Every smile and casual conversation now seemed to carry unspoken emotions.<br>
            Aarav struggled with his feelings too. Although he was relieved to have spoken his truth, he felt uncomfortable knowing that Meera was acting differently around him. He could see the concern or hesitation in her eyes, and it hurt to know that his confession had caused a rift in their once-simple friendship.<br>
            Rohan noticed the changes too. He saw how Meera seemed distracted and how Aarav had become quieter. Rohan wanted to help but wasn’t sure how. The problem was clear, but the solution was not.<br>
            To help lighten the mood, Rohan suggested they play a game. “Let’s play charades!” he said, trying to sound cheerful. “It’s been a while, and it’s always fun.”<br>
            Meera, glad for a distraction, agreed with a smile. “Sounds good. I could use some fun.”<br>
            Aarav, though hesitant at first, felt a small spark of excitement. He hoped the game might help ease the tension.<br>
            As they played, the atmosphere began to lighten. Rohan’s enthusiasm and Meera’s laughter slowly chipped away at the awkwardness. Aarav got caught up in the game and felt genuine enjoyment for the first time in a while. For a short period, the weight of his feelings seemed to lift, replaced by the simple joy of laughing together.<br>
            Charades brought back memories of happier times, when their biggest worry was whether to act out a movie or mimic a celebrity. The fun of the game helped dissolve some of the tension, even if just for a little while.<br>
            As Rohan and Meera joked and laughed, Aarav couldn’t help but smile. The shared laughter was comforting, a reminder of their old bond.<br>
            By the end of the night, the game had brought some relief from the awkwardness. Seeing his friends smiling and enjoying themselves gave Rohan hope that things might get better.<br>
            Meera appreciated the break charades had provided. While she enjoyed the laughter, she knew that the complexities of her feelings for Aarav and the impact of his confession needed to be addressed soon. For now, she took comfort in the moments of connection they had.<br>
            As the fire burned low and the night came to a close, the three of them sat together. They were a little closer than before, but still adjusting to their new reality. The future was uncertain, but for now, they found comfort in their shared laughter and the familiar joy of their game.

But if not then you could come with us, mazza aayega.🙂<br><br> 
            <b>CHAPTER 9: THE UNFOLDING ROMANCE</b><br>
            As the trip neared its end, the atmosphere changed. Meera and Rohan’s relationship had grown deeper. Their affection was clear—how they looked at each other, held hands, and shared glances full of unspoken love. Their bond was getting stronger each day, blossoming in the peaceful setting of the hills.<br>
            For Aarav, however, the trip had not brought the clarity he had hoped for. Instead, it made him feel more like an outsider. Despite being close to them physically, he felt increasingly isolated from the joy and intimacy between Meera and Rohan. It highlighted how alone he felt in this new dynamic.<br>
            One evening, as the sun set and painted the sky with a golden glow, the group began packing up their things. The air was filled with mixed feelings—eager to return home but sad to leave behind the calm of the hills.<br>
            Meera noticed Aarav working quietly on his own, his sadness apparent. She walked over to him, trying to bridge the emotional gap between them. “I’m really glad we went on this trip,” she said softly. “It’s been good for us.”<br>
            Aarav looked up from his packing, his face showing gratitude and sadness. “Yeah, it’s been nice,” he replied, his voice betraying his struggle to stay positive.<br>
            Meera took a deep breath, choosing her words carefully. “I want you to know I’m here for you. I know things have been a bit strange lately, but I still value our friendship a lot.”<br>
            Her words were a small comfort to Aarav. He looked at her and felt a pang of gratitude. “Thanks, Meera. I value our friendship too.”<br>
            Though it wasn’t the resolution Aarav had hoped for, it was something. The acknowledgment of their bond offered a small relief to his heart. It was a reminder that, despite the complexity of his feelings, their friendship was still strong.<br>
            As they continued packing, Rohan joined them, his mood cheerful as he talked about their next adventure. He had noticed the brief, heartfelt exchange between Meera and Aarav and hoped that Aarav would find the clarity he needed in time.<br>
            The drive back to the city was filled with both reflection and anticipation. Meera and Rohan sat close, their conversation easy and their touches frequent. Aarav, seated in the back, looked out the window, feeling heavy-hearted. The trip had been a beautiful escape but also highlighted the reality he faced a reality that was both painful and eye-opening.<br>
            As they reached the city, Meera turned to Aarav, a mix of hope and concern on her face. “We should catch up soon, just the three of us,” she suggested. “Maybe a movie night or dinner.”<br>
            Aarav nodded, appreciating the thought. “That sounds good,” he said with a small smile. “I’d like that.”<br>
            The promise of future get-togethers was a small but meaningful step towards mending their friendship. For Aarav, it was a sign that, while the journey was far from over, there was still room for healing and understanding.<br>
            As they parted ways, Aarav felt both relief and apprehension. The trip had been emotional, but it had also offered moments of clarity. He was still working through his feelings, but he knew that the support of his friends, even if not in the way he had hoped, was important for this new chapter of his life.

            <b>CHAPTER 10: THE RETURN TO REALITY</b><br>
            Returning to the city after their peaceful mountain retreat was a shock for the trio. The energy and excitement of their trip quickly faded as they settled back into their regular routines.<br>
            Rohan, always full of life, jumped back into his activities with enthusiasm. He organized social events, joined in campus activities, and kept everyone’s spirits up with his infectious optimism. It was clear that Rohan wasn’t letting the return to normal life dampen his mood.<br>
            Meera, now more aware of her growing bond with Rohan, found happiness in their relationship. They spent their time exploring new restaurants, attending events together, and dreaming about the future. Their love seemed to blossom effortlessly, with each day bringing them closer together. The little moments they shared, like a smile across the table or a quiet walk hand-in-hand, showed just how deeply they cared for each other.<br>
            Aarav, however, struggled with the transition. Slipping back into his solitary habits was almost automatic for him. He buried himself in his studies, hoping that the comfort of his routine would help him deal with his feelings. The quiet of his apartment felt lonely compared to the lively days they had spent in the hills.<br>
            Weeks passed, and though the trip had been important for Aarav, it hadn’t solved the conflicts in his heart. He found himself adjusting to a new normal—one where he had to accept his feelings and understand his place in their lives. He focused on the positives, finding satisfaction in his academic work, hobbies, and the moments of friendship he shared with Meera and Rohan.<br>
            Even with his complicated emotions, Aarav remained a supportive friend. He was there for Meera and Rohan, celebrating their successes and helping out when needed. His role in their lives might have changed, but he was still an important part of their circle. His quiet support showed the depth of his friendship, even if it came with a touch of sadness.<br>
            Watching Meera and Rohan’s relationship grow inspired Aarav. Their commitment to each other was clear, and it reminded him that love, in all its forms, was something to cherish and respect.<br>
            Amid his personal struggles, Aarav found small moments of joy. He picked up new hobbies, reconnected with old friends, and took comfort in the simple pleasures of life. His journey wasn’t about forgetting his feelings but about accepting them and finding a way to move forward.<br>
            Aarav slowly learned to embrace the complexity of his emotions. He understood that his love for Meera would always be a part of him, but he also knew that life was about moving forward and finding happiness in the present. The friendship he shared with Meera and Rohan was strong, and despite the challenges, he found comfort in knowing he was a valued part of their lives.<br>
            Aarav had learned to handle his feelings for Meera better. Instead of letting them dominate his thoughts, he accepted them as part of who he was. He had come to accept that while he still cared deeply for Meera, his feelings didn’t have to define him.

            I actually have deleted the GitHub page link. It must be showing a 404 error now.<br>
            I am sorry ki maine ye link apni bio mai daala, mujhe nhi daalna chahiye tha. Pata nhi mai kya karoon khudka yaar, maine pehle hi kaha tha ki you should not read what i write and that i dont wanna cause you any trouble aur issi wajah se to I asked you to block me. Aur ab pata nhi kyon mai phirse wahi saari chizen dohra rah, phirse terko pareshan kr rha.<br>
            Pata nhi kyon hoon mai aisa yaar, why I can’t just let things be. I wish I could just sit with my own thoughts, handle them on my own without feeling the urge to share them, only to regret it later. But I promise you, now that the GitHub page is deleted, you won’t have to see any of this again. I won’t let my confusions touch you anymore. Because I know dragging you into these things that arent yours to carry is not fair. And now that the link is gone, I can finally be sure that you’ll have the distance you need, free from the weight of my words.<br><br>
            I made you a birthday note btw. In front, it has a Shinchan and the same quote as last year saying, "I wish you wake up with the same smile everyday." And on the back, it has Cookie and Nugget with Happy Birthday written on it and a quote saying, "May your birthday be just like you."<br>
            I made this note a few days ago, was planning to give you yesterday only. Socha tha ki Lab sbse pehle jaunga aur tumhare 'PC-11' par jakar note rakh dunga. Par tum to mujhse bhi pehle pahunch gyi aur mai kuch kar hi na saka. Then I thought maybe I would give you today after class, par classes to cancel honi hi thi.<br>
            I was in the library yesterday and also had that keychain which I bought this summer, was thinking of giving it to you, socha ki library me hi kisi shelf par rakh doon aur like last year tumhe bata doon by bio or status maybe, par mann nhi maana. So I left the keychain on the table there. It’s probably by the librarian’s desk now, I guess.<br><br>
            I think I have to wish you here only. I know you are not gonna read it par koi baat nahi.<br><br>
            Happy birthday pranjali!

            <b>CHAPTER 11: THE ENCOUNTER</b><br>
            The next day, Rohan, Meera, and Aarav met at their usual café, a cozy spot near their college that felt like a second home. The warm smell of coffee, soft chatter, and familiar surroundings made it the perfect place for them to unwind.<br>
            As they settled into their usual booth, Rohan's eyes wandered around the café. Suddenly, he spotted a familiar face—Naina, the new girl from his philosophy class. She was sitting alone, sipping coffee and reading a book.<br>
            With a friendly smile, Rohan waved her over. "Hey, Naina! Why don't you join us?" he called out, motioning to the empty seat beside him.<br>
            Naina looked up, recognizing Rohan. After a brief pause, she smiled back and walked over to their table. "Sure, I'd love to," she said, her cheerful voice bringing a fresh energy to the group as she took a seat.<br>
            Aarav, who had been focused on his phone, glanced up as Naina joined them. Their eyes met for a split second, and Aarav felt a strange sense of familiarity, but he quickly pushed it aside and went back to his phone, trying to seem uninterested.<br>
            "Guys, this is Naina," Rohan said with a big grin. "She's in my philosophy class. Naina, these are my best friends, Meera and Aarav."<br>
            Meera gave a polite smile, her eyes flicking between Naina and Aarav, while Aarav barely nodded, almost as if he was trying to ignore her. Naina noticed the tension in the air right away. She could see that Aarav was keeping his distance, avoiding eye contact and staying quiet.<br>
            Not one to back down easily, Naina leaned in with a playful smile. "So, Aarav," she began, "Rohan says you're the quiet one in the group. But I’ve always thought that quiet people have the best stories."<br>
            Aarav looked up, surprised by her directness. He wasn’t used to people trying to draw him into conversation so openly, especially someone he had just met. But there was something about Naina’s gaze—something warm and genuine—that made him feel a bit more at ease, even if he didn’t want to admit it.<br>
            "I... don't really have any interesting stories," Aarav mumbled, hoping to steer the conversation away from himself.<br>
            But Naina wasn’t going to let him off that easily. "Oh, I don’t believe that," she said, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. "Everyone has a story. Maybe you just haven't found the right person to share it with yet."<br>
            Aarav shifted uncomfortably in his seat, unsure of how to respond. Her words were light and playful, but there was a kindness in them that caught him off guard.<br>
            Rohan, sensing Aarav's discomfort, quickly jumped in. "Naina’s got a point, Aarav," he said with a grin. "You’re always so mysterious. Maybe it’s time you let someone else in on your secrets."<br>
            Meera, who had been quiet until now, decided to speak up. "Aarav’s just... private," she said carefully. "It’s not that he doesn’t have stories. He’s just selective about who he shares them with."<br>
            Naina nodded thoughtfully. "I get that," she said. "It’s important to trust the people you open up to. But sometimes, talking to someone new can give you a different perspective. I’m not saying spill all your secrets, Aarav," she added with a light laugh, "but I’d love to get to know you better."<br>
            Aarav looked at her, searching her eyes for any hint of insincerity. But all he saw was genuine interest. "Maybe," he said softly, as if considering it for the first time.<br>
            The conversation shifted to lighter topics as the group settled into a more comfortable rhythm. They talked about their classes, upcoming exams, and the little annoyances of college life. Naina skilfully kept the discussion lively, making sure to include Aarav by asking him about his hobbies, especially his love for photography.<br>
            "So, Aarav," Naina asked after a while, "Rohan told me you’re into photography. What do you like to photograph the most?"<br>
            Aarav hesitated, then said, "I like capturing moments... the ones that tell a story without words."<br>
            "That’s beautiful," Naina said sincerely. "It’s amazing how a picture can say so much. I’d love to see some of your work sometime."<br>
            Aarav nodded slightly, a small smile tugging at the corners of his lips. "Maybe," he said, a bit warmer this time.<br>
            Meera watched the interaction with mixed feelings. She had always been protective of Aarav, knowing how sensitive he could be. Seeing Naina connect with him stirred something inside her—a little unease, though it wasn’t about romantic feelings for Aarav. It was more about the comfort of being the one who truly understood him.<br>
            Rohan, on the other hand, was happy to see Naina fitting in so well. He had been a bit nervous about introducing her to his close-knit group, but now he felt relieved.<br>
            As the evening went on, Naina continued to charm the group with her stories and humour. She talked about her childhood, her quirky thoughts on life, and her love for trying new things. Her enthusiasm was contagious, and soon everyone was laughing and sharing their own stories.<br>
            "Aarav, I bet you have a funny story," Naina teased lightly. "Maybe something from your photography adventures?"<br>
            Aarav thought for a moment, then chuckled softly. "Well, there was this one time I was trying to get the perfect shot of a sunset. I was so focused that I didn’t notice I was standing in an anthill. Let’s just say, I had to run really fast afterward."<br>
            The group burst into laughter, and Aarav found himself laughing along with them, feeling a bit more relaxed. Naina’s laughter was the loudest, her eyes sparkling as she looked at him.<br>
            "That’s hilarious!" Naina exclaimed. "See, I knew you had good stories. You just needed a little nudge."<br>
            Aarav smiled, feeling the walls he usually kept up start to lower, even if just a little. There was something about Naina that made him feel like maybe it was okay to let someone new in.<br>
            By the end of the evening, as they gathered their things to leave, Naina looked at Aarav with a playful yet sincere smile. "I had a great time with you guys. We should do this again soon."<br>
            "Definitely," Rohan agreed, clapping Aarav on the back. "And maybe next time, Aarav can tell us more of his photography misadventures."<br>
            Aarav rolled his eyes good-naturedly but couldn’t help but smile. "We’ll see," he said lightly.<br>
            As they all walked out of the café, Naina made a silent promise to herself. She was going to break through Aarav’s emotional walls and get to know the real him. She knew it would take time and patience, but she was up for the challenge. Aarav intrigued her, and she was determined to show him that he didn’t have to face his emotions alone.<br>
            And as Aarav walked beside her, he couldn’t help but feel curious about Naina too. There was something about her that made him wonder if, just maybe, he could finally start to open up again.

            <b>CHAPTER 12: THE SHIFTING DYNAMICS</b><br>
            As weeks went by, Naina became an important part of their group. She joined them for study sessions, coffee breaks, and even their occasional outings. Rohan was thrilled to see Naina fitting in so well. He loved how she brought fresh energy to the group and helped Aarav come out of his shell. However, Meera felt uneasy. The group dynamic, which had once been so familiar, was changing, and she found it hard to adjust.<br>
            One evening, after a long day of lectures and studying, the group was relaxing at their favourite café. As they settled into their usual booth, Meera watched Naina effortlessly blend into their conversations. Naina’s laughter and lively chatter seemed to bring a new kind of energy to the group. Meera tried to keep up with the conversation, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that things were different. Aarav and Naina seemed to be growing closer, and Meera didn’t know how to feel about it.<br>
            Rohan, always the peacemaker, suggested they play a game to lighten the mood. "How about charades?" he proposed, his eyes lighting up with excitement. "We haven’t played in a while, and it’s always a good time!"<br>
            Everyone agreed, and the game began. Laughter filled the air as they took turns acting out prompts. Aarav, who had been quiet at first, started to relax and join in more. He and Naina worked well together, their interactions easy and natural. Meera watched them, feeling both happy and troubled. Naina had a way of making Aarav feel comfortable, something Meera had always struggled with.<br>
            As the game went on, it became clear that Aarav enjoyed Naina’s company. The way he laughed at her jokes and the way they shared smiles showed a side of him that Meera rarely saw. It made her both proud and a little jealous—not because she had romantic feelings for Aarav, but because she missed the simplicity of their old dynamic. The group had always been a close-knit unit, and Naina’s arrival had changed that balance in ways Meera wasn’t sure how to handle.<br>
            Later that week, Meera and Rohan were walking home after a late-night study session. The quiet streets gave Meera a chance to share her thoughts with Rohan.<br>
            "Rohan," she began, her voice uncertain, "I’ve been thinking about how things have changed since Naina joined us. It feels like the dynamic of our group is different now."<br>
            Rohan looked at her, sensing her worry. "I’ve noticed that too, but I think it’s a good thing. Naina seems to bring out a side of Aarav we haven’t seen in a while. He seems happier."<br>
            Meera nodded but still felt unsure. "I know Naina has been good for Aarav, but I can’t help worrying. What if things don’t turn out the way we hope? What if Naina ends up hurting him, even if it’s unintentional?"<br>
            Rohan wrapped an arm around Meera’s shoulders, offering comfort. "We can’t predict the future, Meera. All we can do is be there for Aarav and support him. Naina seems to genuinely care about him, and that’s a good thing. Let’s trust that things will work out."<br>
            Meera appreciated Rohan’s reassurance but couldn’t shake her concern. She knew Aarav tended to keep his struggles to himself, and she feared that getting closer to Naina might complicate things in ways she wasn’t ready for.<br>
            In the days that followed, Aarav and Naina spent more time together. Naina had a way of drawing Aarav out of his shell, getting him to open up in ways he hadn’t before. Their conversations went beyond surface-level topics, and Aarav found himself sharing more than he usually did. Naina seemed to understand him in a way that others didn’t, which both intrigued and unsettled Aarav.<br>
            One evening, as the group gathered for dinner at their favourite restaurant, the changing dynamics between Aarav and Naina were clear. Naina’s charm and wit drew everyone in, and Aarav seemed to thrive in her company. Meera noticed this and felt a mix of emotions. She was happy to see Aarav enjoying himself but couldn’t ignore the growing tension within her. The familiar rhythm of their friendship was being replaced by something new, and she didn’t know how to feel about it.<br>
            After dinner, as they walked outside, Meera found herself alone with Naina for a moment. Seizing the chance, Meera decided to share her concerns.<br>
            "Naina," Meera began cautiously, "I’m glad you’re in our lives. Aarav seems to be opening up more, and that’s a good thing."<br>
            Naina looked at Meera, her eyes reflecting empathy. "Thank you, Meera. I’m just trying to be there for him. He seems to have been through a lot, and I want to support him in any way I can."<br>
            Meera nodded, her expression thoughtful. "I appreciate that. Just be careful with his emotions. Aarav’s been hurt before, and I want to make sure he doesn’t get hurt again."<br>
            Naina’s gaze softened. "I understand, Meera. I promise to be mindful of that."<br>
            Meera offered a small smile, feeling reassured by Naina’s words. She hoped that Naina’s understanding and patience would help Aarav continue to heal and find happiness.<br>
            As the days passed, the complexities of their relationships continued to evolve. Aarav and Naina’s bond grew stronger, while Meera and Rohan worked to maintain their supportive roles in Aarav’s life.<br>
            But amid all these shifts, Meera struggled with her own feelings. The familiar comfort of their group had been altered, and she wasn’t sure where she fit within the new dynamic. She felt a sense of loss for the simplicity of their previous interactions and worried that the growing closeness between Aarav and Naina might bring challenges she wasn’t ready to face.
