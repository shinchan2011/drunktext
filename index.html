                <p>Hi!<br><br>
                    Kitni ajeeb baat hai na, ki pehle tu mujhe apne baare me sab bataya karti thi, aur ab jab sab kuch waise hi chal rah jaised ki tum chati thi to hamari baat hi band ho gayi.<br>
                    Itna mushkil hai kya yaar, ek Hi kehna. Session ke starting week mujhe kaafi bura laga, phir khayal aaya ki jab tere liye har chiz theek ho hi gayi to phir ab kya hi fark padta hai. uske baad maine ek-do baar koshish bhi ki tujhse baat karne ki, socha ki tu kabhi saamne se ayegi me Hi karunga aur uske baad to baatein start ho hi jayegi lekin najane kyon tu jab bhi aas paas hoti hai to mujhse nazrein hi nahi milati, aur phir kuch dinno baad to maine bhi chor diya ki jaise chal raha chalne do. Tu to keh rahi thi ki sab kuch thik ho jayega, lekin sab to aur bhi bikharta jaa raha, apan phirse wahi aa gaye jahan ek saal pehle the. Ab mai kaise na maanu ki I am the third person in this story. Sach kahun to pichle semester kuch zyada hi ehmiyat de di tune mujhe, itni nahi deni chahiye thi. Nahi karti baatein, ab tumhe to bahoto log kahenge ki they have a crush on you, to iska matlab ye to nahi ki tum apni saari baatein unhe batane lago. Aur mai tumhe ye sab isliye nahi keh raha taki tumhe bura lage balki isliye keh rah kyonki mujhe khudke liye kaafi bura lag raha hai yaar. Terko pata hai mere sath hamesha aisa hi hua hai, I mean chizen kabhi mere hisaab se chali nahi lekin iss baar jinta bura lag raha hai utna kabhi nahi laga, kyonki shayad itne efforts maine kisike liye kabhi maare hi nahi. Terko pata hai before you, I have never sketched anyones portrait. Aur tumhara sketch banane se pehle maine 12 copies aur banayi thi aur 13th time mai jo bana tha vo maine tumhe gift kiya aur sath ke sath pichle 12 sketches bhi maine sambhal kar rakhe the, lekin tumhare birthday ke samay wale chat ke baad maine saare fek diye. Terko to shayad pata hi hoga ki last sem mera kitna hectic tha, itne saare classes, phir upar se Gaurav sir ki extra classes, 4 labs, Enyugma ki website, phir samwaad me juniors ko handle karna, aur phir SIH, aur phir ICPC bhi. Aur din ke akhir me waqt bachta hi nahi tha, lekin phir bhi har din raat ko waqt nikalkar mai Cookie and Nugget ki story likhta tha, sirf isliye ki har din hamare pass baat karne ke liye akhir kuch to ho, aur aksar tumhe gaane bhi bheja karta tha ki din ke akhir me tumhare pass kuch naye gaane ho sunne ke liye. Terko pata hai tere birtday ke waqt college ke bahar mujhe gift wrap nahi mil rahi thi, to usse kharidne ke liye mai tilkamanjhi chala gaya tha. Aur tere birthday ke agle sham mujhe fever tha lekin phir bhi tumhe gift dene ke liye mai academic building tak gaya. Aur kyon? kyonki kisi doosre ko insan ko tum apni koi sabse keemti chiz de sakti ho to wo waqt hai, isiliye maine tumhe apna poora waqt diya, bas yahi dikkat hai mere sath ki mai seedhe seedhe kuch nahi keh pata, lekin baaki har tareeke se maine tumhe batane ki koshish ki. Dekha jaye to mujhe tumhare jitna koi nahi jaanta is college me, tumhe to mere gaano ki playlist tak pata hai yaar, aur iske bawajood sath hi sath tumhe andaaza bhi nahi ki tum mujhe kitni zyada pasand ho. Aur sach kahoon to ab shayad sab khatm ho gaya yaar, akhir me mai sirf ek aisa ladka banke reh jaunga jiske sath tum kuch mahino ke liye dost thi, bas.

                    Hi Miku!<br>
                    Aur batao kaise ho?<br>
                    Well technically its already 31st par kya hi fark padta hai. I hope ki tum bhi abhi tak college pahunch hi gayi hogi. Well kaisi rahi wedding, I hope ki kaafi enjoy kiya hoga. Yaar maine ek baat notice ki hai, ki apan jab bhi college se bahar gaye hai, to sath me hi gaye hai. Like sabse pehli baar last year 26 jan ke waqt, phir october end me, tu ghar gayi thi aur mai maasi ke wedding me, aur third time abb, interesting right? Chalo choro ye baatein, batao kya kya hua wahan par. Chalo pehle mai hi start karta hoon. Apan 24th ko college se nikle the, jaane ke waqt flight se apna arrival time sync nahi ho rah tha to apan train se gaye the first BGP-Howrah then Howrah-kayamkulam. Howrah wali journey itni acchi nahi thi kyonki mere seat ke thik peeche ek pyari si bacchi thi jo poore raste mere seat par laat marte hue gayi thi, uske karan me poori journey so hi nahi paya. Phir howrah me kuch ghante ke liye hum Biraj ki maasi ke ghar ruke the. Unn kuch ghanto me uski maasi ne hame khana khila khila kar hamari halat kharab kar di thi. Phir howrah to kayamkulam wali journey bhi itni kuch khaas nahi rahi, hamare next compartment me hamare hi saath ek aur ICPC ki team jaa rahi thi aur vo theeno poore raaste coding kar rahe the, unhe dekh kar hum depress ho gaye the, ki kahin hum series dekhkar kuch galat to nahi kar rahe. Phir mere thik next seat me ek uncle ji the jinhone apne kharrato se mujhe poore raaste sone nahi diya. At last 26th evening ko apan kayamkulam pahunch gaye. Station se hame pick karne college ki bus aayi thi. Apan campus me enter kiye aur hame realize hua ki actual college campus dikhta kaisa hai. Phir apan ko rooms allocate hue jo ki main building se almost 1km door thi. Hame har samay itni door chalke jaana padta tha, aur raaste me ek nadi aati thi to hame bridge paar karna padta tha aur phir hamara room 5th floor me tha aur building me lift bhi nahi thi, aur majje ki baat to ye hai ki ye sab campus ke andar tha. Baaki sab to thik hi tha 28th ko apna main contest tha aur apan se sirf do hi questions bane. Phir 29th ki subha hum kochi ke liye nikal gaye aur poora din hum city ko jitna explore kar sakte the kiya. Aur phir aaj subah humne Kochi se Hyderabad ki flight li phir airport me khana khaya jo ki kaafi mehenga tha, phir 5 ghante baad hamne doosri flight li patna ki aur abhi 31st ki subah ke 1 baj rahe hain aur mai bhagalpur ki train me hoon. Agar train late nahi hui to subah 5 baje tak pahunch jayenge. Kaafi hectic ho gaya right? Ek aur baat kehni thi, saari me tu bohot sundar lagti hai. Well, kaafi neend aa rahi hai mujhe ab, Bye, kabhi aur baat karenge.<br>

                    Hi Miku!<br>
                    Yaar ab to ek mahine se bhi zyada ho gaya. Akhiri baar hamari baat 25 dec ko hui thi. Chalo chodo ye saari baatein, ye batao ki kaise ho? Mai to thik hi hoon, aur I guess mera to sab okay okay hi chal raha. Classes kaafi sari hain, aur haan ek interesting baat hai, Abhinav sir thermodynamics chorkar baaki doosre subjects bhi padhate hain, lekin unki class me neend to ab bhi aati hi hai. Terko pata hai kuch din pehle, pehli baar purnendu sir mujhse haskar baat kar rahe the, vo pooch rahe the ki hamara ICPC kaisa gaya, maine kaha ki thik thak gaya par hum next round ke liye qualify nahi kar paye phir unhone kaha ki kamse kaam tumlog wahan tak pahunche to aur phir unhone kaha to nahi par unki aankhen keh rahi thi ki he was very proud of us. I noticed your new glasses, kaafi jach raha hai tumpar.<br>

                    Aur batao kaise ho?<br>
                    Mai to theek hi hoon. Aaj to saari classes cancel ho gayi. Mai subah gaya tha pooja mai actually aur mujhe wahan tum dikh gayi uske sath aur phir najane kyon mai adhe raaste hi lautkar aa gaya. Aisa kai baar hota hai shayad tujhe bhi pata ho par iska ye matlab nahi ki mujhe tujhse koi shikayat hai ya mai tujhse naraz hoon. Par najane kyon tumhe dekhne ke baad me hamesha aise behave karta hoon. I guess ye itni badi baat nahi hai, kuch dinno me thik ho jayega. Waise bhi akhir tum shuru se yahi to chahti thi. Aur mai tumhare liye kaafi khush bhi hoon. Ya I know not the whole of me but a part of me is really happy for you. Aur waise bhi zinta tu usse pasand karti hai utna to shayad mai bhi tujhe nahi karta.<br>
                    Bye, khayal rakhna.<br>

                    Bahut thak gaya mai aaj, yaar. Pichle do dinno se lagatar poore din acedemic building me hi beet gaya, Phir aaj subha subha Inauguration aur sham ko cultural night, kaafi hectic tha, Par maza bhi aaya. Chalo choro ye sab, ye batao kaise ho? Sabkuch kaisa chal raha. Yaar mera to kuch hi hectic ho gaya hai sab, itna kuch manage hi nahi ho pa raha ek sath, shayad Samwaad ka incharge nahi banna tha mujhe. Waise tune gymkhana ki site me contribute karne se mana kyon kar diya. Yaar, terepe load nahi aata zyada, apan sab milkar bana lete. Chalo choro ye baatein, agle hafte midsem hai, tayyari ho gayi, meri to bilkul nahi hui yaar. Sabne itna kuch padha diya hai, upar se Himadri sir kya padha rahe kuch samajh nahi aa rah.  Lekin baat to ye bhi hai ki pehle bhi kuch kahan samajh aata tha, ummeed hai ki midsems acche jaye. Aur tu bhi chinta matt tere bhi acche hi jayenge. Mai bhi yaar kya faaltu ki baaton me tumhe uljha raha hoon, tumhe padhna bhi hoda, chalo kabhi aur baat karenge. Best of Luck for midsems.<br>

                    Hi!<br>
                    Well, its 3:40 in the morning now. Pata nahi achanak se aankh khul gayi. Aur ab neend hi nahi aa rahi. I miss those days when I used to wake up and see if you have texted me back. I know that from getting to know someone, to loving them, its such a long journey. And I know you didnt have the emotional capacity to start the whole process again with someone. I guess when we're young, we just believe there'll be many people with whom we'll connect with. And later in life, we realize it only happens a few times. I think it happened to you. That you have met that people of you. And if I am right, if you really have then no matter what happen just dont let him go. I wish that it never happens that you both stop talking to each other. But somehow if it does happen then please remember that, when we loose touch with someone, we just try to store up all the things in our mind that we want to tell them from every big events to every small details and we think that the next time when we will meet I am gonna tell her/him everything, but it just never happen so, right. Because when we finally see each other we either just ignore them or just fake it saying that whatever happened, happened for good. And even if we gather the courage to tell them what we really want to, we just end up talking about big events thinking its too much bother to talk about the little things but its the little things that makes up life, right. I know people say that its never late for anything but trust me it doesnt always work like that. So if you ever loose touch with him and the next time when you meet him then please spill your heart out and tell him what you had been keeping inside you for so long and not because he will be unaware of those things, but because its the right thing to do. And tell him that its his memory that always make you happy whenever you think about it. But just remember whenever you tell him just tell him in person and not in chat. And if you missed anything that you wanted to say then save it for the next time and just spill that out no matter if the topic you are talking in is different cause you know you dont have to be perfect around him and he will understand you anyway.<br>

                    Hi!<br>
                    I am lying on my bead right now, having a little headache, came back from Varanasi 2 hrs ago. Well if you ask me the past few days was really fun. Well, we left on 28 afternoon, and reached varanasi the morning after. We almost didnt sleep at all that day, took off for Kal bhairav Mandir directly after bath. Then from there we went Kashi Vishwanath Mandir, and waited for 5hrs straight in sunlight, after that we had breakfast or you can say brunch as it was 12noon then. After that we had few juice as it was really hot and then shopped a little and then after that we looked for auto but we didnt get any and had to walk all the way to gurudwara, oh by the way I forget to mention that we stated in Gurudwara, actually paji's father is the secretary of a Gurudwara there so we got VIP rooms. So we slept through the afternoon and went for the Ganga Arti of Dashashwamedh Ghat and it was really beautiful and i just that pretty much cover the our day one.<br>The very first thing that we did the next day was breakfast at a roadside stall and their dosa is one of the best that I ever had. And the stall owner turned out to be a really friendly guy, he set us up with a E-Rickshaw that gave us atmost the whole tour of the city. First he took us to Sarnath,  where we explored the Dhamekh Stupa and a fascinating museum. Then, off we went to Namo Ghat, we spent a little time there. Next stop was the Ramnagar Fort, followed by a visit to BHU where we checked out the Vishwanath temple. The day continued as we visited the Durga Kund Mandir and then made our way to Assi Ghat, where we had a boat ride from Assi Ghat to Manikarnika Ghat and with that our second day came to an end.<br>On the Third day we booked a car and went to Vindhyachal, there we explored three mandirs Vindhyavasini Mandir, Kali khoh Mandir and Ashtabhuja mandir and after that we went for Chunar fort and after that Dev went home and we had our train at evening which got late by 12 hrs so we had to book a room near station. We boarded the train at sunrise and reached college at 4.<br>So that was pretty much the zist of our trip, hope you didnt got bored. I wish if I could ever visit those places again with you.<br>
