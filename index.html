                <p>Hi!<br><br>
                    Kitni ajeeb baat hai na, ki pehle tu mujhe apne baare me sab bataya karti thi, aur ab jab sab kuch waise hi chal rah jaised ki tum chati thi to hamari baat hi band ho gayi.<br>
                    Itna mushkil hai kya yaar, ek Hi kehna. Session ke starting week mujhe kaafi bura laga, phir khayal aaya ki jab tere liye har chiz theek ho hi gayi to phir ab kya hi fark padta hai. uske baad maine ek-do baar koshish bhi ki tujhse baat karne ki, socha ki tu kabhi saamne se ayegi me Hi karunga aur uske baad to baatein start ho hi jayegi lekin najane kyon tu jab bhi aas paas hoti hai to mujhse nazrein hi nahi milati, aur phir kuch dinno baad to maine bhi chor diya ki jaise chal raha chalne do. Tu to keh rahi thi ki sab kuch thik ho jayega, lekin sab to aur bhi bikharta jaa raha, apan phirse wahi aa gaye jahan ek saal pehle the. Ab mai kaise na maanu ki I am the third person in this story. Sach kahun to pichle semester kuch zyada hi ehmiyat de di tune mujhe, itni nahi deni chahiye thi. Nahi karti baatein, ab tumhe to bahoto log kahenge ki they have a crush on you, to iska matlab ye to nahi ki tum apni saari baatein unhe batane lago. Aur mai tumhe ye sab isliye nahi keh raha taki tumhe bura lage balki isliye keh rah kyonki mujhe khudke liye kaafi bura lag raha hai yaar. Terko pata hai mere sath hamesha aisa hi hua hai, I mean chizen kabhi mere hisaab se chali nahi lekin iss baar jinta bura lag raha hai utna kabhi nahi laga, kyonki shayad itne efforts maine kisike liye kabhi maare hi nahi. Terko pata hai before you, I have never sketched anyones portrait. Aur tumhara sketch banane se pehle maine 12 copies aur banayi thi aur 13th time mai jo bana tha vo maine tumhe gift kiya aur sath ke sath pichle 12 sketches bhi maine sambhal kar rakhe the, lekin tumhare birthday ke samay wale chat ke baad maine saare fek diye. Terko to shayad pata hi hoga ki last sem mera kitna hectic tha, itne saare classes, phir upar se Gaurav sir ki extra classes, 4 labs, Enyugma ki website, phir samwaad me juniors ko handle karna, aur phir SIH, aur phir ICPC bhi. Aur din ke akhir me waqt bachta hi nahi tha, lekin phir bhi har din raat ko waqt nikalkar mai Cookie and Nugget ki story likhta tha, sirf isliye ki har din hamare pass baat karne ke liye akhir kuch to ho, aur aksar tumhe gaane bhi bheja karta tha ki din ke akhir me tumhare pass kuch naye gaane ho sunne ke liye. Terko pata hai tere birtday ke waqt college ke bahar mujhe gift wrap nahi mil rahi thi, to usse kharidne ke liye mai tilkamanjhi chala gaya tha. Aur tere birthday ke agle sham mujhe fever tha lekin phir bhi tumhe gift dene ke liye mai academic building tak gaya. Aur kyon? kyonki kisi doosre ko insan ko tum apni koi sabse keemti chiz de sakti ho to wo waqt hai, isiliye maine tumhe apna poora waqt diya, bas yahi dikkat hai mere sath ki mai seedhe seedhe kuch nahi keh pata, lekin baaki har tareeke se maine tumhe batane ki koshish ki. Dekha jaye to mujhe tumhare jitna koi nahi jaanta is college me, tumhe to mere gaano ki playlist tak pata hai yaar, aur iske bawajood sath hi sath tumhe andaaza bhi nahi ki tum mujhe kitni zyada pasand ho. Aur sach kahoon to ab shayad sab khatm ho gaya yaar, akhir me mai sirf ek aisa ladka banke reh jaunga jiske sath tum kuch mahino ke liye dost thi, bas.

                    Hi Miku!<br>
                    Aur batao kaise ho?<br>
                    Well technically its already 31st par kya hi fark padta hai. I hope ki tum bhi abhi tak college pahunch hi gayi hogi. Well kaisi rahi wedding, I hope ki kaafi enjoy kiya hoga. Yaar maine ek baat notice ki hai, ki apan jab bhi college se bahar gaye hai, to sath me hi gaye hai. Like sabse pehli baar last year 26 jan ke waqt, phir october end me, tu ghar gayi thi aur mai maasi ke wedding me, aur third time abb, interesting right? Chalo choro ye baatein, batao kya kya hua wahan par. Chalo pehle mai hi start karta hoon. Apan 24th ko college se nikle the, jaane ke waqt flight se apna arrival time sync nahi ho rah tha to apan train se gaye the first BGP-Howrah then Howrah-kayamkulam. Howrah wali journey itni acchi nahi thi kyonki mere seat ke thik peeche ek pyari si bacchi thi jo poore raste mere seat par laat marte hue gayi thi, uske karan me poori journey so hi nahi paya. Phir howrah me kuch ghante ke liye hum Biraj ki maasi ke ghar ruke the. Unn kuch ghanto me uski maasi ne hame khana khila khila kar hamari halat kharab kar di thi. Phir howrah to kayamkulam wali journey bhi itni kuch khaas nahi rahi, hamare next compartment me hamare hi saath ek aur ICPC ki team jaa rahi thi aur vo theeno poore raaste coding kar rahe the, unhe dekh kar hum depress ho gaye the, ki kahin hum series dekhkar kuch galat to nahi kar rahe. Phir mere thik next seat me ek uncle ji the jinhone apne kharrato se mujhe poore raaste sone nahi diya. At last 26th evening ko apan kayamkulam pahunch gaye. Station se hame pick karne college ki bus aayi thi. Apan campus me enter kiye aur hame realize hua ki actual college campus dikhta kaisa hai. Phir apan ko rooms allocate hue jo ki main building se almost 1km door thi. Hame har samay itni door chalke jaana padta tha, aur raaste me ek nadi aati thi to hame bridge paar karna padta tha aur phir hamara room 5th floor me tha aur building me lift bhi nahi thi, aur majje ki baat to ye hai ki ye sab campus ke andar tha. Baaki sab to thik hi tha 28th ko apna main contest tha aur apan se sirf do hi questions bane. Phir 29th ki subha hum kochi ke liye nikal gaye aur poora din hum city ko jitna explore kar sakte the kiya. Aur phir aaj subah humne Kochi se Hyderabad ki flight li phir airport me khana khaya jo ki kaafi mehenga tha, phir 5 ghante baad hamne doosri flight li patna ki aur abhi 31st ki subah ke 1 baj rahe hain aur mai bhagalpur ki train me hoon. Agar train late nahi hui to subah 5 baje tak pahunch jayenge. Kaafi hectic ho gaya right? Ek aur baat kehni thi, saari me tu bohot sundar lagti hai. Well, kaafi neend aa rahi hai mujhe ab, Bye, kabhi aur baat karenge.<br>

                    Hi Miku!<br>
                    Yaar ab to ek mahine se bhi zyada ho gaya. Akhiri baar hamari baat 25 dec ko hui thi. Chalo chodo ye saari baatein, ye batao ki kaise ho? Mai to thik hi hoon, aur I guess mera to sab okay okay hi chal raha. Classes kaafi sari hain, aur haan ek interesting baat hai, Abhinav sir thermodynamics chorkar baaki doosre subjects bhi padhate hain, lekin unki class me neend to ab bhi aati hi hai. Terko pata hai kuch din pehle, pehli baar purnendu sir mujhse haskar baat kar rahe the, vo pooch rahe the ki hamara ICPC kaisa gaya, maine kaha ki thik thak gaya par hum next round ke liye qualify nahi kar paye phir unhone kaha ki kamse kaam tumlog wahan tak pahunche to aur phir unhone kaha to nahi par unki aankhen keh rahi thi ki he was very proud of us. I noticed your new glasses, kaafi jach raha hai tumpar.<br>
                    Bye, khayal rahkna.

                    Hi Miku!<br>
                    Aur batao kaise ho?<br>
                    Mai to theek hi hoon. Aaj to saari classes cancel ho gayi. Mai subah gaya tha pooja mai actually aur mujhe wahan tum dikh gayi uske sath aur phir najane kyon mai adhe raaste hi lautkar aa gaya. Aisa kai baar hota hai shayad tujhe bhi pata ho par iska ye matlab nahi ki mujhe tujhse koi shikayat hai ya mai tujhse naraz hoon. Par najane kyon tumhe dekhne ke baad me hamesha aise behave karta hoon. I guess ye itni badi baat nahi hai, kuch dinno me thik ho jayega. Waise bhi akhir tum shuru se yahi to chahti thi. Aur mai tumhare liye kaafi khush bhi hoon. Ya I know not the whole of me but a part of me is really happy for you. Aur waise bhi zinta tu usse pasand karti hai utna to shayad mai bhi tujhe nahi karta.<br>
                    Bye, khayal rakhna.

Chalo choro ye sab, ye batao kaise ho? Sabkuch kaisa chal raha. Yaar mera to kuch hi hectic ho gaya hai sab, itna kuch manage hi nahi ho pa raha ek sath, shayad Samwaad ka incharge nahi banna tha mujhe. Waise tune gymkhana ki site me contribute karne se mana kyon kar diya. Yaar, terepe load nahi aata zyada, apan sab milkar bana lete. Chalo choro ye baatein, agle hafte midsem hai, tayyari ho gayi, meri to bilkul nahi hui yaar. Sabne itna kuch padha diya hai, upar se Himadri sir kya padha rahe kuch samajh nahi aa rah.<br>

                <p>She looked at her phone and it was 9.30 in the morning. She had her breakfast, then she was lying on her bed, she didn't had school that day. And then she went out, she had her camera with her, she was obsessed with taking photos, so she went to a nearby river and took few photos, and then she head back. She didn't wanna go home that soon, as she had pretty much nothing to do. While on her way back she stopped by a movie theater and she went to the counter and found out that she is a little short on cash so she took the ticket of the cheapest movie available. She went inside and it was totally empty and there was only one boy at the other corner of the hall.  After few minutes the movie started and it turned out to be a french movie with no subtitles<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Hello!, where are the subtitles ?<br>
                    No one responded, but she got the attention of the boy, and after that he stood up and walked straight to her and sat next to her.<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - You watch, I'll translate.<br>
                    She looked at her suspeciously, he looked at her back.<br>
                    
                    <b>The Girl</b> - I think I'm just gonna go tell the theater owner.<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - Ya well you could, but I don't think it will do any good, cause I've seen it before and there's no subtitle.<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - I can get my money back.<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - But its a really good movie, I don't think you want to miss it.<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Does it have a happy ending?<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - No, definitely not.<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Okay...<br>
                    <br>
                    And then he started translating  <br>
                    <br>
                    The movie was almost three hours long and it had a sad ending so the girl got tears, and after the movie was over she found out that she is holding the boys hand.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - I'm sorry. How long was I doing that?<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - I don't know but maybe for an hour I guess.<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Why didn't you say something ?<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - The movie is a bit of a downer, so..<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Its a love story..<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - I mean, not all love stories are downers<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - All the good ones are, Romeo and Juliet, La La Land, The English Patient. I think  its the ending of a relationship, that makes a love story so memorable.<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - What about Pride and Prejudice? Jane Eyre? Those both have happy endings.<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Thats only because the writer chose to end thier love stories prematurely.<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - Wow, that is a really interesting way of not admitting you're wrong.<br>
                    (The girls started laughing)<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Okay, picture this. Picture that Leonardo Dicaprio didnt die at the end of Titanic<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - Do I have to?<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Yes, you have to.<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Jack Dawson is a jobless, penniless gambler, who possessed, at best, marginal artistic talent. <br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - He saved Rose's life<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Right, of course<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - But he also love-bombed her and stole her away from her fiance, which obviously was a asshole who don't deserve her. And poor Rose was so into the love of Jack that she thought that he'd give her a life of passionate adventure? I mean come on. That's a life of poverty and ...<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - My god you have really given your thoughts on that, huhh<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Oh I did.<br>
                    'A man who works on that theatre comes in and says'<br>
                    The Man - Okay, the movie is over...<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - Yaa well okay.<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - So, how did you get so good at speaking French?<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - My dad is a foreign language professor. So he had me fluent in French, Spanish and Italian by the time I was 12.<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Woww, thats impressive..<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - Yaa, I get that a lot..<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Really ?<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - No, actually I have never gotten that before.<br> 
                    <br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - Well, I should probably..<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Yea, I too have to go.<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - umm, thank you for letting me whisper in your ear for three hours<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - You are welcome.<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - Bye..<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Bye<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - Jeremy<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - what?<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - My name. its Jeremy<br>
                    <b>The Girl</b> - I'm Melissa<br>
                    <b>The Boy</b> - Maybe I'll see you here again sometime<br> 
                    <b>The Girl</b> - Yeah. I would like that.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And then they shook hand and he left<br>
                    <br>
                    (she regret that she didn't asked for his number)<br>
                    <br>
                    But after that day whenever she had time she used to go to that cinema to wait for him, but he never showed up.<br>
                    <br>
                    Then one day she went to an event with her friends, it was rowing actually and one of her friends was participating in it too and as she was taking their photos she saw that a boy came in her frame, well he was in tha background and it was all blurry, so she changed the lenses and looked again and it was him. Well at the end her friends loose the race but the team they lose to was Jeremy's.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She went to talk to him, (He was lying on the ground, as he was too tired afetr the race)<br>
                    <b>Melissa</b> - Congartulations,<br>
                    <b>Jeremy</b> - Melissa, hey.. oh (he sstood up and stumble over her)<br>
                    <b>Melissa</b> - woah.. woo.<br>
